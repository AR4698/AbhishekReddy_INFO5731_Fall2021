Refer to Chapter 9 (p. 106) for more information on comma-delimited files. To answer this question, you will need to download the file [Assignment1_denton_housing.csv](https://github.com/unt-iialab/info5731-fall2021/blob/main/assignments/Assignment1_denton_housing.csv) included with this assignment. The file [Assignment1_denton_housing.csv](https://github.com/unt-iialab/info5731-fall2021/blob/main/assignments/Assignment1_denton_housing.csv) contains statistics about housing in the city of Denton from 2008 to 2014.
