dominicwood-14504,9,Who knew a superhero film could be so beautiful?,"I'll start by saying that if you're looking for a great story, you'll be disappointed. Shang-Chi is a pretty standard hero's journey at its core, which is a shame because the story could have been inspired by House of Flying Daggers and other wuxia titles.

So why a rating so high? Because where the story falls, everything else excels.

Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and a real treat for the eyes with some visuals that are incredibly distinct for the MCU. In regards to aesthetics, Black Panther walked so Shang-Chi could run a marathon.

The fight scenes are all amazing. There's one weak fight, but it's meant to be weak, and they're all very long, which is great to see. One of the early ones went on for a solid 5 - 10 minutes, which was unexpected but far from disappointing.

The first actual fight scene is my favourite in the MCU, and I was worried none of the others would top it, but they were all delightful to watch, and I was so glad they did a parallel of it later on. Either way, the writers went hard on the fight scenes and that paid off.

In summary, the story is lacking, but I'm glad in a way because that allowed everything else to shine. And shine, it did. I hope future directors take lessons from the aesthetics and choreography of Shang-Chi.",4 September 2021
laviniadallam,10,something unique and fresh,"After 10 years of almost every movie being.armed combat, this one is fresh and the perfect start for phase 4 (yes, the start is with black widow but is something ""old"", too related to the previous phases), i loved every single moment, i got chills, i laughed. The soundtrack is astonishing, as the.cinematography. The best of the mcu if i may. Loved the colors. The fighting sequence leave you attached to the screen as they seem like they are dancing. All combined is something else, completely new and i can't wait to see more of simu liu as shang-chi because he was.brilliant.

Go see the movie!!",2 September 2021

1. "" So -{ MANY }- Upsides : ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden MARVEL"" { Gosh . . . . where do I even start‚ùì} "" : Ang Lee's circa 2000 quasi-mystical Martial arts spectacular is the -Very- first film that came to my mind whilst watching a certain beautifully -{ "" Atmospheric "" }- segment of the opening-act of 'Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings' ( 'Shang-Chi' for short ) . . . . you'll know it -Immediately- upon seeing it . . . . featuring ""ever-fabulous"" Malaysian Mega Star Michelle Yeoh ; who of course was one of the -Principal- characters in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', -As well- . { FYI : this is by no means intended to be a spoiler ; -several- of the movie -official- teasers & trailers 'gallantly' feature the said scene, albeit briefly }. And what's more ...( trailers also )... if you're someone with 'even the slightest bit' of true passion for all things within the realm of sheer cinematic -{ FANTASY üå† }- , then you'll be absolutely -delighted- to know that Shang Chi -Also- has a distinct 'Harry Potter' aspect to it . . . & if even -that's- not enough for you . . . Then, get this, its got a 'full-blown dollop of Narnia' thrown in there for good measure, at that. To be -Really- honest, it felt a bit disorienting , -At First- , seeing all ""those types of elements"" in an 'MCU' ( 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' ) picture, but then I suddenly realized that 'Infinity War' -And- 'Endgame' both -Very- prominently feature, well ...{ a walking, -""Talking""- demolition derby of a, err, -""Raccoon""- }... in them, & I began to feel at home again, pretty darn quick.

2. "" There -Is- One 'Stark' Downside, Alas . . . . The MCU has had -{ WAY }- Too Much ""Muddled & Obfuscatory"" Messaging Vis-a-vis 'The Ten Rings', Over The Years "" : In 2008's -superbly- received { and completely -iconic- } 'Ironman', which is where we were all introduced to the bespoke militant organization, ( 'TTR' for short ), for the -Very- first time . . . . there is an ""Explicit And Unequivocal"" reference to the film's ( initial ) setting as being sometime within the USA's long 'War In Afghanistan', ( where the -Official- state religion is Islam ).

'yet another' archetypal, classic ""Islamist-fundamentalist"" type group. When in fact, as is -Strongly- conveyed to us in -This- particular picture, ( beginning all the way with the trailers itself ), that this is simply -{ Not }- the case.

Certainly very confusing, -especially- for the majority of us, who -haven't- read any 'Mandarin vs. Shang-Chi' comics . . . . Go Figure ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§î .

mhatreritesh,9,It's a Visual treat,Perfect Fantasy film to watch with full family.. you can't miss this on big screen.,4 September 2021
nishantsalhotrans,10,Best non-avengers MCU movie,"Keeping it short. This movie had it all. Great story, writing, direction, acting, villain, comedy and fight direction.

I'm a huge old school kung-fu movie fan and I was a bit sceptical about how they will show the fight scenes. Glad they kept it authentic with the fight director (who worked with Jackie Chan a lot). It was insane.

The story itself was superb. The villain's character development was amazing. The direction was not rushed and at the same time it didn't bore me for a single second.

Best non-avengers MCU movie for me. I can watch this again today after watching it last night.",6 September 2021
truthtellers-16825,8,Fun Film That Does What It Is Supposed To,"Brought to you by the Truth Tellers.

Film is great overall and in this genre at least, is one of the best all year round that has been generally lacklustre. Definitely a good movie to watch as it does what it is supposed to in that it is generally a setup film for something bigger in the MCU.

Like many of the other Marvel Films in the MCU, they have to start somewhere. As an origin film it does it very well and perhaps the best origin / starting film for superhero movies that is full of action, decent story that is somewhat predictable (as it is for most origin stories) though generally fresh, fun and great characters. Definitely one to watch.

Final Verdict - Does what it is meant to do and provides the entertainment while doing it.",1 September 2021
csheff3,9,"Honestly it's great, beautiful martial arts galore","Haven't been much of a Marvel guy even with their biggest event films, but Shang Chi is solid. Story moves quick, lots of great characters, almost nonstop action scenes, and a finale that they hid from the trailers. I was definitely way more into it than I thought I'd be. Props to the team on this one!",4 September 2021
IliescuVictor,9,Out of the Marvel patterns,"I had very few expectations from this one, given the fact that it was an origin story with a character I know zero facts about. But let me say this, it competes with the Avengers movies when comes to cinematography, visuals and action sequences.

By far the best Marvel movie in the recent years, that puts many titles from its portfolio to shame.

The visuals are a blast, a true eye candy experience. There are a lot of new elements that Marvel seemed to experience with and it worked out perfectly. The choreography is spot on, as the fighting sequences are among the best I've seen, and combined with a good score, it turns out to be a very enjoyable seeing on the big screen. I think it's mandatory to watch Shang-Chi on the biggest screen you can get to.",2 September 2021
handaloo,7,"It's not as bad as people are saying, it's also not quite as good.",null,4 September 2021
JATIN-1989,4,What's up with these extreme positive reviews?,"I watched this movie after Twitter was claiming it to be the best movie ever, so I went with high expectations, after watching what I found is movie was mediocre at best, the CGI was great but apart from it everything is just ok at the best, I didn't connect with any character at all. To be honest wait for the film to come on streaming services, not worth it to go to the cinema.",4 September 2021
MrSAsheC,5,Honest: A decent movie but don't expect anything you haven't already seen from Marvel.,"It's a decent movie. Happy that the comedic timing in certain scenes isn't overdone and it plays out to be a little more serious. The Mandarin in the movie by far the best acted out character and the choreography of the martial arts is on point. The movie is probably about 15 mins too long just when you think ""oh it's finishing up"" there's more. There is a notable difference in the second act with the story going more rapid and pacing is definitely the movies biggest flaw. Acting wise it's cool, nothing amazing or something you haven't seen before.

If you're familiar with marvel it's the exact same model as some of the other movies with it being about family (Thor, Black Widow).

Wanna have a good time with the family or just a decent watchable movie? This is one that you'll like.",2 September 2021
delsoca,7,Strong 7/10,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.",4 September 2021
wgeddings,9,A return to good Marvel movies,"If you are like me, from the previews and ads you thought this was a Kung Fu movie about a son rebelling against his crime lord father and the father sends men to force him to return and make him take over as the next leader of the criminal empire. Not an awful plot but not that original either. That is absolutely NOT what this movie is about. I love and hate that Marvel's trailer seldom give anything away and I am glad they are doing it again. That is not at all what this movie is about and I will not spoil anything.

The performances are good, the story is good and while not complicated, it keeps your interest. Funny parts, touching parts, action parts, it is overall just a good movie that was enjoyable to watch. It is not one of the best Marvel movies but it is a solid one and worth seeing in the theater.",5 September 2021
MiroslavKyuranov,8,Absolute Banger!,"That was a freakin' blast! The story is complex and interesting it fills some gaps in the MCU and simultaneously is a great origin story for the character of Shang-Chi.

The whole cast is amazing, I mean there is so much chemistry between them. Simu Liu and Tony Leung are phenomenal in their respective roles. The Mandarin tho...so well created character.

The movie is amazing bridge between East and West culture. There is so much to explore, much like Wakanda. The history of Shang's culture is so rich.

The fight choreography is absolute kick in the gutts...in a good way. I mean this is something completely new for the MCU and they deliver it again! Everything looks so goddamn good and I can't help myself thinking about some scenes! Also, the colors, the effects, the camera work and etc. Everything is magnificent.

There is humor for sure, but there is also emotional impact. This is not some bland action packed movie, it's made with heart from fans for the fans. Kudos to the director Destin Cretton!

Killer soundtrack and the main song for the movie ""Run It"" fits so good with all.

There are a few surprises, that were hidden from the promos and trailers and man...just wait to see them.

About the credit scenes...they are two, both are good, but one of them is...SICK!

For sure deserves more than one viewing in the cinema, so much story building, details, action, fun. The people who underestimated this movie will be so surprised how great is it.",1 September 2021
adamthorn-31294,10,Amazing,Shang-Chi was honestly amazing. The cinematic experience was great and the story and plot of the movie was very good too. I am a huge marvel fan and it makes me happy to see that they are branching out to different types of hero's from all types of backgrounds. To sum up my review I really enjoyed it and highly recommend. (stay for the credits to the end),5 September 2021
Izzy2727,2,Stop Disneying our Marvel Dammit,"Couple of things, 1. The actors are made of plastic, I know it wasn't a CGI cartoon but the actors were so one dimensional it may as well have been. Have never seen live actors display the uncanny valley. 2. Feels alot more like a Disney film and less like a Marvel super hero movie. 3. It was super formulaic, Awkwafina was as usually not funny and every little chuckle was super forced. Overall had some good fight choreography but you can get that in any other Kung Fu Movie. Kind of makes you wonder why so much money was spent on a very very very template movie. Kind of lame.",4 September 2021

lakelazy,10,One of the Best Marvel Movies of This Year,"This movie portrays a villain that by far has been the best out of all the other Marvel antagonists. It shows his personal conflicts, his purpose, as well as his cruelty. The hero of this film are overshadowed by this, but the ending really makes a mark on the audience. Also the martial arts and action scenes are a treat to watch and the core of the film is about family.",1 September 2021

casualmovienerd,1,Martin Scorsese Was So Right,"Martin Scorsese called most of these generic MCU movies theme park movies and This movie is perfect example of that. There are some great MCU movies, but seems like Marvel isn't even trying to separate themselves from theme park stigma, when they make movies like this.",3 September 2021
teomslaer,4,Great visuals but slow moving,"Well the fight scenes were exciting , the story was incredibly slow. Not the best Marvel movie but not as weak as movies like Thor: The Dark World. Some of the best visuals in any movie I have seen which helps improve the overall experience. Keep an eye out for a fun character to pop up as well!",3 September 2021

Overall fantastic movie with the point of view of storyline and action sequences which really are one of the best among all marvel movies till now.

mandynguyen-89365,10,Amazing,Such a good movie. The asian representation is on point. If I could give this movie past a 10 star rating I would. Can't wait for what else marvel has in store.,7 September 2021
mephisto2424,8,The perfect start for phase 4,"It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and The cinematography, choreography, plot - it could not have been done better. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. CGI and the fight scenes were stunning!

The perfect start for phase 4 (I know, the start is with black widow but is something ""old"")Marvel hasn't made such a masterpiece since Black Panther.",4 September 2021
kakuskari,10,Shang Chi is a Emotional Roller Coaster,"Shang Chi is an emotional roller coaster. Using the strength of its powerful and interesting villain, the movie successfully brings together the past 10 years of Marvel movies into a largely effective cocktail of super-heroic dramatics. Destin Daniel Cretton creates a superhero movie that it's every bit the epic that it needs to be. However prepared you feel, you are not ready for the villain, Mandarin . Shang Chi is stunning, hilarious and heartbreaking and one of the best action set pieces of this year which is the bus scene.",1 September 2021
pewpewds-27356,10,Blew away my already high expectations,"I had very high expectations and Shang-Chi still blew me away. Definitely the best Marvel movie to date, the story was great. The villain wasn't boring and didn't have lame motives, the characters were well written, the music was fantastic and the fight scenes and special effects were amazing. It's also a very easy movie to understand and enjoy if you aren't very well versed in Marvel movies as it's Shang-Chi's introductory movie. Highly recommend.",6 September 2021
valmont1702,9,"Poetry in motion, layered story, emotional adventure. A sparkling jewel.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a wonderful movie in so numerous ways... Visually striking, with a great mastery of the staging from beginning to end.

So much visual poetry, the legend/adventure aspect of it is really top-notch, with legends & mystical elements that grab you ever more with the story unveiling before your eyes ... The humor is very pleasant (Katy, played by Awkwafina, brought a welcome energy & heart in each of her scenes) and adds a pretty pleasant flavor to the whole adventure.

I really loved the way the characters are written, with Xu Wenwu (Tony Leung) as a complex & layered figure all along the movie... And Xialing (Shang-Chi's sister, played by Meng'er Zhang), as well as Li (their mother) are both highly enjoyable to see express themselves on-screen, they both have a lot of presence (and skills), each in their own ways.

I found the entire movie very coherent, every detail makes sense and is counter balanced in a way or another... Yes, there is a strong notion of balance (darkness & light, and so on), with a lot of messages infused in both the action & dialogs. It is an extremely entertaining movie, but I really wanted to emphasize the richness and depth of its story/mythology and characters, all connected in the most organic way.

By the way, I loved the whole Asian/Chinesz myths & legends aspec of the movie, the spirit & philosophy of it all was a true delight to my eyes, with countless Sci-Fi elements entwined in it, but all smoothly integrant of this mythology... I think I probably put it in my Top 5 Marvel movies... I found the staging really majestic, from the dialog scenes to the action scenes, the humor, the flashbacks, and this new ""universe"" (mythology) that is presented here, it just all flows in such a delightful way from beginning to end.

Marvel Studios always are very very clever at hiring a great variety of talents, and they nailed it once again... Destin Daniel Cretton (the director of the movie) is super creative and manages to construct pretty complex scenes while always masterfully telling a story, building a deeply cohesive piece ; it's all fantasy but nonetheless feels visceral and real. This movie is another Marvel movie you often forget that it is a Marvel movie, precisely because of its powerful and so deeply captivating mythology, and this emotional weight that you can feel over the characters, it truly sets something different. It felt like I was watching a movie in the vein of certain epic Asian adventure/martial arts movies... Gotta admit it's my jam, so... In addition to the Marvel stuff, it's a very pleasant feeling.

The energy in the movie theater was fun, lots of people were excited from all these scenes that just grab you. Because yes, clearly... There is a good number of mind-blowing scenes in this incredible movie ! The photography and color treatment make the movie very striking... And like I said, certain scenes mesmerize you because of their beauty & mastery, or even their grand epicness ! At times, it feels like an epic fresco that you are contemplating.

The scene when/where the two parents meet for the first time is beyond gorgeous (the setting, the colors, the choreography, the costume design and overall design, the music & sound effects, the characters and the atmosphere as a whole) ; an absolute masterpiece of art, visually way beyond sublime, what a gift for the eyes, wow... And the 'Grand Final' is quite simply epic, emotionally grabbing, and of course stunning visually, with a flow of glorious shots that all are impressive.

A jewel.",1 September 2021
Sleepin_Dragon,9,Wow!,"I was not expecting that, I had visions of a film along the same lines as Snake Eyes, that was an out of date bagel, this was a four course banquet.

Fast paced, energetic, and relentless, not particularly the genre I normally go to, or enjoy, but I loved every second of it, a visual masterpiece. Superb acting, terrific musics, but it's produced in such a magical way, it is stunning.

I plan on seeing this again, just to understand a few bits a little more.

The storyline was alright but the CG was very good. They used lots of Chinese culture tradition, costume & symbols. Looking forward to see the next sequel.",3 September 2021
fallenheroangel,1,Somehow even Tenet managed to have more personality,"It's so extremely generic and made with no passion or soul in it.

I'll be the first to admit that I was very sceptical about what really amounts to a glorified Kung Fu movie finding its place in the MCU. I need not have worried. Shang Chi sits right up there with the very best Marvel has on show.

Simu Liu and the ever wonderful Akwafina make a fantastic duo and the addition of the queenly Michelle Yeo and the wonderful Tony Leung is the icing on the cake. It's exciting, adventurous fun. So go see it, you definitely won't regret it!",3 September 2021

I always though marvel universe movies have less fight , all reunited, with a classic Hong Kong movies such John Woo ones.

Here my toughs are listened and this is easely the most fight based of all MCU movies ever.

msbreviews,8,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU!,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings just became one of my absolute favorites of the entire MCU! Destin Daniel Cretton delivers an entertainment-heavy movie with arguably the best action ever seen in the cinematic universe. Through the outstanding mix of long takes, impressive fighting choreography, and jaw-dropping stunt work, Simu Liu shines with his martial arts skills, but also in tackling the identity issues of the protagonist. Marvel gains yet another emotionally compelling antagonist, as well as a relatable female character that embodies many elements of the Asian-American culture. Despite an overreliance on unnecessary, excessive exposition devices (narration, flashbacks, foreshadowing), the story behind all the tales and legends never loses interest. From the breaking of stereotypes to a remarkable depiction of their culture, most Asian viewers will certainly love this film, even more than I do. Phase Four is off to a remarkable start...""

Rating: A-",3 September 2021
PedroPires90,8,Good,"One of the best origin MCU films. Good story, great and complex family relationships, with it's own identity, a very good balance between action and comedy and really good fight scenes. Between Simu Liu, Awkwafina and Tony Leung it's difficult to decide which was the best, but the acting was really strong all around (also a mention to Ben Kingsley, always funny!). The best thing I can say about it is that for most of it's duration it didn't even feel like an MCU film.

The negatives? Again, too much CGI. It's a huge problem with Marvel and Disney as they use the green screen in almost every scene. I like CGI but seriously, some scenes would look much better with practical effects, others would look way better if they just were shot at location.",8 September 2021

PerryAtTheMovies,9,Fantastic if you don't know the comic story....,"Overall: 91/100

This is more geared towards non-Marvel people than for the Marvel people.

Quick & Dirty: I loved it and would highly recommend seeing this film in theatres. Visually stunning, fantastic fight scenes, great story, and emotionally driven. Due to one too many lulls perhaps a slight bit too long in length, but overall, very enjoyable.

When I was teen I loved watching Asian films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""House of Flying Daggers"", & ""Ong-Bak"". This film had the great martial arts fighting sequences that the aforementioned films had. I felt like I was a kid again enjoying something fresh and new. I also fully enjoyed the combination of Mandarin (apologies if that's wrong) and English. A movie with subtitles always reminds me that there's more than the bubble of North American film.

The acting was great. Michelle Yeoh was the one who stole the show for me at the end of the day. Again, it reminded of the good old days of martial arts movies that depended on the actors to make things believable instead of lots of CGI.

I watch virtually zero Marvel movies and so if you're iffy on whether to watch this or not it shouldn't stop you from enjoying this film. It's funny, action packed, and does not appear to be culturally inappropriate. The acting is great and the length of the film, while a little long, is still exceptional.

PS... there are two after the credits scenes so make sure you have time sit until the very end.

Enjoy the show!",3 September 2021

waltermwilliams,8,A Marvel Legend has risen,"A Marvel Legend has risen and it only took 40 years to become an overnight sensation.

""Kim's Convenience"" star Simu Liu breathes life into the title character who's changed his birth name to Shaun.

What a stretch when you don't want to be found by your estranged dad, Xu Wenwu otherwise known as The Mandarin, played by Tony Chiu-Wai Leung (in his first American film) who has more rings than Ringo Starr or the Olympics.

What can I say this guy loves his bling.

Rapper/Actor Awkwafina is his BFF, Katy.

Together Shaun goes out of his way to avoid bringing back the dead with his wisecracking ""Crazy Rich Asian"" girlfriend in tow.

Simu was so intent of getting this gig that back in 2018 he tweeted Marvel for the role.

Kung Fu fans are in for a solid 2 hour plus fight spectacular, which doesn't stop too long to draw breath.

This movie never gets boring.

It's Action, Adventure and Fantasy all rolled into one thrill ride straight out of the Marvel Universe.

I kind of half expected 80's Singer, Limahl to crank out ""Never Ending Story"" in the final act of this epic movie thanks to one of the legendary creatures hiding out in a mythical village not unlike Shangri-La from 1937's classic ""Lost Horizon"".

Car maker BMW clearly have a product placement deal with Producer, Kevin Feige.

They are driven, crushed or smashed in every automobile scene.

Hawaiian Director, Destiny Daniel Cretton, best known for ""Just Mercy"" and ""The Glass Castle"" does a marvellous job with the Screen Play and Screen Story he helped write based on the source material from Marvel Comics Steve Engelhart and Jim Starlin.

This movie idea has been floating around since the 80's when the late Stan Lee wanted Bruce Lee's son, Brandon to play the lead, but that plan fell through.

Australia actually played a huge part in this movie finally being produced despite World War C's best attempt in 2020 to shut down production.

Watch out for: Michelle Yeoh plus Aussies Ronnie Chieng, Lynette Curran and Lydia Sarks (from the Toyota Commercials) as the hilarious Flight Attendant.

Like all good Marvel movies there is an Easter Egg worth waiting for before the cinema lights come on and the curtains close on the big screen.

And just like the movie this review doesn't mention the title till the final frame, ""Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"".

Do yourself a favour and take the family to see the 25th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe which is full of surprises and cameos.

daisukereds,5,Sort of disappointed..,"I got to admit I wasn't particularly blown away by anything in the movie.. I might even say ""I was bored"" by it.

Don't get me wrong.. it IS a spectacle! The action is great. The locations are nice, costume design, sound design, etc. But it is overall a soft release not worth seeing in theaters.. specially as a follow-up to what Endgame was.

The biggest problem for me, is how the underwritten lead has muddled personality (for reasons covered in the story) devoid of charm, personality or good dialogue.

The next issue is the humor, which didn't land for me.. Not once. The supporting lead Awkwafina isn't her normal ""loud"" self that's supposed to be funny every time she opens her mouth. Her role is very supportive and a little dramatic. And while I questioned myself why was she even there for, it doesn't ultimately matter. She is another forgettable character that is given more importance than the role deserves.

Finally, the third act is weak. There's a balancing problem with stakes. You can't feel tension or weight to any action. And there's a lot of superficial ""I can't do it"" until they can.

In the end, this feels like a very safe plot, written in a way to appeal to china (considering how the Mandarin is portrayed), that ends up appealing to no one specific. Certainly doesn't feel like a Marvel movie.. but it was bound to happen if we are to be introduced to different aspects of the narrative. But it also doesn't feel like a comic book. It's more generic than that.",16 September 2021

hypestyle,9,Easily the best Superhero Film of 2021,null,6 September 2021
PotassiumMan,9,Great superhero entertainment with a classic storyline,"The charm of this movie comes from the setting of the main characters, showing a reflection of today's world, where Asian culture and the way of life in the west creates an environment of searching for one's own identity and place - this is where we meet Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) first. A young adult trying to navigate through his life far away from his family in the city of San Francisco. His partner in crime is his best female friend Katy (Awkwafina).

Simu Liu's character arc in this film is not significant. Although he makes a solid protagonist, his own character development is de minimis. Awkwafina, by contrast, steals the film as the ordinary person caught up in the epic power struggle. Her trademark zingers and bemused quips make her the perfect foil against the escapist superhero world that she- and we as the audience- are thrust into. Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai) is a subtly effective Marvel villain with a compelling family backstory; he is a cinematic antagonist with the most idealism and righteous sense of purpose since Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"".

Michelle Yeoh as Shang-Chi's aunt Jiang Nan has again some great fighting scenes which stand up to her wonderful performance in ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"". Overall this movie has great fighting scenes, extraordinary effects, especially the flying dragons which are delightful to watch. Highly recommended for everyone who likes superheroes and a touch of mysterious fairytales.",6 September 2021

The visual effects in this movie were fabulous, there were plenty of captivating scenes with astounding usage of modern technology. The cinematography was probably one of the best I have seen in a film for a while, it kept you captivated and on your toes the entire time! I also noticed light being used to make the scenes even more captivating, which is something you don't always see in films.

The dialogue was solid and didn't feel clunky or wierd, the jokes were well spaced and gave your muscles a rest from being tensed.

The action was perfectly filmed and beautiful, it felt like they were dancing. The choreography was very impressive.

The story itself was nothing unexpected, pretty much a generic origin story, but don't worry that doesn't take away from the film at all!

And lastly the villain was for me one of the most interesting aspects of the film, they made you feel for him and gave him an interesting charachter with a non-generic motive, I haven't felt for a villain this much for a long while.

PS: There are two post credit scenes so stay after the credits.

PART WITH SPOILERS And I just wanted to say I loved the return of Trevvor Slattery! It was such a surprise and something they managed to keep out of the trailers, he was hilarious especially where he played dead. Also I like the fact Wong played a role in the film, the scenes with him were interesting. The post credit scenes set up the sequel which I will be very interested to see!

The comedy, the action, the themes, the choreography and the vibrant visuals make this film a standout among similar standalone Marvel films, while the layered and truly epic soundtrack is the finishing touch. While some of the effects and the pacing perhaps could have been a little more polished, and the final battle had some weaknesses, this is a colourful, emotional and fun rollercoaster of a film. Tony Leung is by far the standout member of the cast, delivering a captivating and even sympathetic villain. Simu Liu holds his own, but needs more time to really shine as a new Marvel superhero-while Meng'er Zhang, Awkwafina and Fala Chen are integral to this film's effectiveness.

Gorgeous costumes and Joel West's soundtracks, with Chinese motives, aptly create an atmosphere of a magical world we haven't seen before. I won't say anything bad about the script either. I didn't mantion any plot holes, and the bonus was good jokes and a touching and sometimes tragic family story. Bill Pope's balanced shots and amazing special effects, which have definitely reached a new level, also go to the film's pluses. A special tribute to the director of the fights Andy Chang.

The presentation is very stylish, the special effects were superb and the martial arts fight scenes were fast and exciting The plot is good, focusing on the human and family side of the characters rather than the magical, and sets up a good intrigue for the continuation of the MCU. The acting is good and although the comic relief and cute character did change things up, they also spoiled it a bit and made the slow middle section drag on even more.

kjproulx,9,A Very Fresh MCU Entry,"When Iron Man hit theatres back in 2008, there were rumblings about a cinematic universe starting, but obviously, nobody expected that we would make it to a film like Avengers: Endgame at the time. Along the way, unknown properties like Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man came out of nowhere as well but were welcomed with open arms. I was really hoping that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings would follow in those footsteps, and it more than does. With rich world-building, a great cast, and the use of mythology, this is one of my favourite Marvel Cinematic Universe entries to date. Over time I may even come to appreciate it even more. After a first viewing, here's why Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings deserves to be seen on the big screen (if you can).

After being trained as an assassin by his father, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is given ten years of freedom from this life. In the present, the film picks up with Shang-Chi (Shaun) as he is living a normal life in San Francisco with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the history/mythology of the so-called Ten Rings is brought back into the forefront, his mission is to go and find his father. With the help of his friend and sister, they return home to face the music and it may just end up being father vs son to save this world. From start to finish, this film delves into the fun, the mythological, the family drama, and some incredible martial arts in order to tell this very solid story.

Aside from the fact that newcomer Simu Liu is undeniably charming and very likeable in this role, it's the unique style of the movie that made it stand out from the rest of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Yes, it still has the same look and feel, especially when it comes to aesthetics and comedic relief, but the rest of the film had its own distinct heartbeat. Bringing martial arts into this franchise just felt like a breath of fresh air to me. Not only does it feel simultaneous that they're trying to have fun and pay homage to classic films of this nature, but the fact that martial arts, mixed with actual god-like powers just felt so earned by the climax of the film. Without giving anything away, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is far more magical and mystical than I was expecting, but I kind of loved the finale when looking back on it.

There's really not much about this film that I feel compelled to complain about, but I will say that with as much drama that this film has and with how much it does dive into mythology, sometimes the comedy felt out of place. Awkwafina as Katy was great and I think her chemistry with Simu Liu was great as well, but I think certain cuts to her one-liners felt a little unnecessary for the specific situation. There are a few scenes where moments deserve our full attention, but the film felt the need to cut away to something funnier. Aside from the humour taking me out a few times, this film is just a blast.

Overall, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Tens Rings is easily at the top of the origin films that this franchise has given us and probably one of my favourite entries as a whole. Director Destin Daniel Cretton (Short Term 12, Just Mercy) has done a great job here and the cinematography by Bill Pope (The Matrix, Baby Driver) was also a real standout. I thought the scope of the movie felt very grand and that's absolutely in part to how it was filmed. I almost thought the finale of the movie was going to be a huge negative, but again, after thinking about the movie again, there is a nice progression in the story that makes the climax feel earned, even if a tad overblown. If you're a fan of this franchise, this one is a must-see, but even if you're not, this one can stand on its own as well, having only a few acknowledgements to previous films.

adriano-40012,10,Shang-Chi made an impressive start into the MCU,"Lovely plot, great characters, awesome designs & costumes. As a martial artist fan I loved the fight choreography & stunts. They felt fresh and authentic.

The mix between Martial Arts, Action, Fantasy & Drama was great. I was worried about the movie, when I watched the trailer. The CGI effects were amazing. Just felt like it didn't needed it. The movie got its own marvel flavor, when the cgi scenes took over.

I had a lot of fun during watching. Specially the fighting scenes, action scenes and with a lovely humor.

The acting was fantastic. Shang-Chi's character development was great just overshadowed by his fathers character in my opinion, cause the story of his father was somehow more interesting. The chemistry between Shang-Chi & Katy was the icing on the cake. So lovely and perfectly matches into the movie.

This is the first Hollywood movie for Tony Leung. He did an amazing job.

I think it's safe to say they did well to represent Asian culture on a big movie screen. I highly recommend this to every marvel fan. They did an outstanding job.",4 September 2021

Perhaps this generations 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon', both of which are visual spectacles to behold. 'Shang-Chi' is full of beautiful creatures, costumes, martial arts, and acting. Probably the best fighting in the MCU, which makes sense (though Cap and Winter Soldier fighting is my personal favourite). The real Mandarin makes his debut and does not disappoint, Tony Chiu-Wai Leung was fantastic. All the other cast members were very likable as well. A few appearances from other MCU characters, including a surprising one that somewhat redeems himself.

This movie is bolstered by a fantastic performance from Simu Liu, who I hope will star in many other great films. His charisma alone is a good reason to like the movie. The supporting performances weren't quite as memorable, but of course, they were not bad at all.

Movi3DO,6,Overhype,"Shang-chi, the most disloyal man in MCU: he has 10 rings for 10 wives.

Phase 4 continues with a new blockbuster with an all main Asian cast. Having escaped from his father, Shang-chi was forced to face his past and embrace his true self.

Is this movie good? The answer should be no, despite how much people overhyped this. However, I did enjoy the fight choreography and beautiful visuals. This honestly doesn't mean a lot, considering that this is a Marvel's project. The cast did an okay job themselves, and some comedic moments land.

If you actually take this movie seriously and don't get distracted by all the colors and actions on the screen, it should be clear that this was an overhyped, mediocre at best Marvel movie. It's not bad like Captain Marvel, but it's not good. There is barely any depth to the story. This type of story was done like a gazillion times, and this movie didn't add a lot into the tropes. The progression was formulaic, and you already know what the end would look like from the beginning.

Our main character, Shang-chi, again, was typical and bland. The actor wasn't necessarily bad, it's just that the writers didn't try hard enough to make the character more compelling or special. Also, the dude just randomly knew how to crazy stuff near the end, despite never wear the ten rings himself before.

Also, in typical Marvel fashion, the phenomenon of ""OH I know that person from somewhere else"" (*insert Leonardo DiCarpio's pointing meme*) was used as another distractor. Sometimes it's good and all, but remember that this made no impact on how good a movie is.

Which directs your attention to the post-credit scenes. Again, another overhype train from people. Reality is: they aren't that special.

Overall, just calm down people. A mediocre Marvel hero movie. Doesn't mean it's a bad movie. 6.5/10.",6 September 2021

mostafaw-31454,7,A good action *marvel* movie,"What I like :

1)the action, especially in the first half and the building scene that make me nervous and scared on the characters

2) great visuals and good cinematography, colors, cgi was really amazing

3)I love the acting

4) a good villan that really do everything for a purpose not because he is the bad guy so he acts like that (like the villan of ""black widow"" movie)

Now, what I don't like

1)like every marvel movie the movie begins strong and introduce the characters then it becomes more slow with good comedy and some action and we go to a journey to the final battle full of cgi fights, OK guys there are some people who love cgi fights but not me, the fight was a bit terrible and predictable (honestly I love the action in this movie but not the final battle)

2) the movie is full of emotional scenes but (do I feel anything? No)

3) the music was good but not epic and there is no great theme for shang chi (I loved the music and the songs but it wasn't good enough)

Overall good action movie with a great action sequences and good comedy and good villan and cinematography and cgi, but it's a *marvel* movie, with cgi final battle and weak ending and a good setup for what comes next

movieman6-413-929510,6,"With Shang-Chi, Marvel presents their first Asian superhero in a good and cultural way.","Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a new superhero movie in the Marvel film series. The film is directed and written in part by Destin Daniel Cretton, the director of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy.

The film is about Shaun (Simu Liu), who tries to put his past behind him and just wants to enjoy his life with his best friend Katy (Awkwafina). When the mysterious organization the Ten Rings finds Shaun, he is forced to confront his past after all. To do this, he must take his birth name Shang-Chi again, to protect Katy and his sister Xialing (Meng'er Zhang) from the actions of the Ten Rings and their leader Xu WenWu the Mandarin (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung) who is also Shaun. His father.

This film is Marvel's first superhero film starring an Asian actor. Furthermore, with this film they also bring out the Asian culture and fighting styles well. For this they have used other movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon as an example. Fans of this film can recognize moments that refer back to these films. They portray the fight scenes where characters fight each other with Asian fighting styles well and entertainingly. The art of the Asian fighting style is somewhat overshadowed when characters use more supernatural powers in the film. Fight scenes where this happens are less exciting and entertaining than scenes where characters fight each other in more normal ways.

At one point, the film also feels like you're watching a live-action mix of the Asian animation shows Pok√©mon and Avatar: The Last Airbender. These scenes provide some extra comedy and are especially more entertaining for younger viewers. The movies and costumes of the film cast also help with the emergence of Asian culture in the film. The visual effects are also put to good use in the film. Except for a few scenes, it can be seen that they have used a green screen for the background, but fortunately this is not disturbing in the film. Creatures can also be returned before the start of the film. A bit redundant on a few action scenes with 3D effects in the film.

The acting is well done by the film cast. Simu Liu took to Twitter to ask Marvel to play the part, with both parties quickly making a good deal. Simu Liu comes across as good and charismatic as the lead of the film and further conveys the action sequences beautifully. Along with Awkwafina, he also has good chemistry in the film and together provide good appropriate humor. The comedy also doesn't overshadow all the dramatic aspects in the film, which sometimes does happen. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung also portrays the villain of the film in a good and sympathetic way, so that as a viewer you understand why he does what he is doing to me. This film is also only his first English-language role in an American film. Although this is only his first time, he still delivers good and appropriate acting. Meng'er Zhang does not get that much time in the film, but a bit less good or present in the film.",2 September 2021

Its thrilling & races along at a great pace from the first scene! It is the perfect mix of Action Fantasy & lighthearted comedy with a decent story line to bind it all together, one could say another typical Marvel movie churned out of their factory production line, however, I felt that this one really is miles better than so many of the recent ones due to the incredible martial arts fight scenes, they are so fast it's really exciting to watch. I also enjoyed the fact that I didn't recognise any of the main actors other than Ben Kingsley (who is hilarious) this often makes a movie much easier to get into than when it's the same old super star faces.

I also saw one review who gave a 1/10 and said it was because of one of the actors in the post credits scene. For the people who are reviewing bad reviews don't like a new superheroes being Asian.

The movie was a perfect it made you feel sorrow for the character and the position he was in between his father. You could feel the weight he had on his shoulders. The beginning of the movie starts with the fear of unknown, you don't know who is after him. You go through many happy and sad emotions.

Still, It's entertaining, visually stunning and it's out of the MCU's pattern which is great. However, I'm not convinced of the Mandarin's motives. It kinda lacks evilness ( ""She"" is his weakness and that's why He's been easily manipulated by a beast and that kinda sucks).

There were 2 superhero cameos, and larger parts for Wong from Dr. Strange and Ben Kingsley reprising his role (as an actor hired to play a terrorist) from the Iron Man 3.

saikatsamanta,7,People are going a tad bit Crazy with the Praise !!!,"First of all, I think People are overhyping this film a bit like they did Black Panther. Is this the Best MCU Origin Film Ever ?? Hell No !! There are atleast 3 better origin stories existing. But there's a lot of good things Shang-Chi does that differentiates this film from the normal MCU film. The Visuals are breathtakingly beautiful and unlike any MCU film I have seen. The tone of the film resembles Chinese Action Movies more rather than MCU which is so refreshing. The first few fight scenes are just incredible and got me super hyped but the quality falls in the later scenes when it becomes a CGI Monsterfest. The story is very predictable and full of narration and exposition. At its core its a very emotional family drama but the dialogues are not powerful enough to dig really deep and I craved for that in so many scenes. The performances are solid with Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley providing great Comedic Relief, but the standout is Tony Leung.

ferreiranazli,10,one of the best solo movies on the MCU,"Visually, one of the most beautiful movies in MCU. More than that, one of the best solo super hero movies in MCU, a grand feat for a debut, even more so without other superheroes like ""crutch"". The performances make justice for the script, showing us that End Game, contrary to what was believed, wasn't the end of Marvel Era. The phase 4 promises be even greater than others. This quality can be easily compared to Black Panter and Captain America and The Winter Soldier level.

Engaging and with the right dose between comedy and battle, the film has impressive fight choreographies.

The credit scenes make connection between the Shang-Chi story to the MCU in a curious way. Can't wait to see what Feige is planning for the future.",6 September 2021

statuskuo,9,There's Dragon Fights!,"What more do you want?

I honestly didn't want to like this film. As you may have read in previous reviews of the Marvel films, they are all dumb. And this one ends as they all do, with just massive CGI chaos. But did I mention they were dragons fighting?

Anyway, the film is fun. Fun and lively in the sense of watching a water painting come to life. The fight sequences are laborious...sometimes. Since being rocked with energy source that could topple buildings doesn't even crack a rib seems silly.

But Shang-Chi makes it work. Here played by the moon-faced wide-eyed and fun loving Simu Liu. And he does a wonderful job NOT wanting to be anything but a typical slacker. While he carries the burden of a darker past..haunted, even...he does his best to make the best of his situation with his San Fran pal Katy. Now usually Awkwafina irritates me to no end. Here, she is much more subdued and is truly a ""bro"" any guy would want in a sisterly form/love interest. The balance of her hip banter to seriousness is flawless. And quite the joy when not on screen.

Big kudos to Tony Leung. Who has spent generations emoting with the most efficient use of words. He doesn't require much and carries a lot. He plays a former evil doer whose only motivation is love.

His fatherly love for his children is only surpassed by regaining a love he's lost. And truly embodies that person who cannot let it go. But that credit goes to Li, played by Fala Chen. A gentle soul in what can be described as Shangri-La. I could watch her do kata for hours. Her gracefulness would make any man want to open the gates of Hell for.

Much praise goes to director Destin Cretton for balancing spirituality with family ties. This is a very difficult line to tow while trying not to be overbearing. He was smart enough to know that the family dynamics of an Asian household have small passive-aggressive moments that pick at the main characters. But doesn't ever go past the ""you must have honor"" trope that infects a movie like ""Mulan""",4 September 2021
Anurag-Shetty,10,Marvel gives us another unique & unforgettable superhero.,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings tells the story of Shaun/Shang-Chi(Simu Liu). Shang-Chi is an expert of Kung Fu. He is forced to deal with his past, when he's pursued by the Ten Rings organization.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a mind-blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe strikes gold yet again & can do no wrong! Director Destin Daniel Cretton has given us one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best origin stories. The action set pieces are the highlight of the movie. It's awesome to finally see the Kung Fu fighting style, utilized in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are awe-inspiring. Simu Liu is spectacular as Shaun/Shang-Chi. Liu easily balances the action, dramatic scenes & the Marvel Cinematic Universe's trademark humor. Can't wait to see more of him in the future. Awkwafina is hysterical as Katy. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is outstanding as Xu Wenwu. Meng'er Zhang is fantastic as Xialing. Fala Chen is brilliant as Li. Michelle Yeoh is excellent as Ying Nan. Florian Munteanu is superb as Razor Fist. The supporting cast is amazing. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans & superhero film buffs. Watch it on the biggest screen possible, preferably IMAX. Can't wait for Eternals(2021)!",4 September 2021
matthewgolbourn,9,"The MCU, has a massive hit on its hand with Shang-Chi","""Simu Liu"" really brings everything to life and embodies Shang-Chi to complete perfection, almost as if he was born for this role, to a point where he will become marvel fans new favorite, and In my opinion, is on par with the casting likes of ""Roberts Downey Jr"" (bold statement I know), but along side ""Simu Liu"" actress ""Awkwafina"" will also steal the hearts of many fans, bringing many smiles and laughs to viewers faces and becoming something so much more then just a side character, fans will route to see her more and more in the future future.

The actions scenes are nothing but bliss to see, perfectly choreographed fights that really capture the style and heart of martial arts. The special effects are beautiful to the eye and in the last two acts will simply blow you away and introduce you to a new world to see and new life to capture you and completely immerse you into the world of Shang-Chi.

As for the story, Shang-Chi carries alot of weight and heart, that will provide many laughs with its humor but will also pluck the strings of every ones heart, with out saying to much, Shang-Chis story is something of a symphony with its story telling, what could of ended up being a basic story, end up being a deep, thrieving with life, story with plenty of meaning, with a broken family at its heart, each character has their story, taking their different paths back to be whole again. Some fans my leave with a tear or two.

As a whole, Marvel manages to yet again, provide us an amazing cast to embody its iconoc comic characters and bring everything and every one to life on screen. Shang-chi, is a consistent adventure from start to finish and provides nothing but pure MCU entertainment at its finest, and will leave fans begging for more of Shang-Chi.",4 September 2021
minge-79873,9,A fresh entry to the MCU!,"After being disappointed by Black Widows' solo outing and not knowing anything about a minor comics character I feared for Shang-Chi. But I was not disappointed.

Straight off and you get a cultured vibe honouring Asian film and tradition and you get superb action and charismatic characters all well delivered by a strong cast.

Reminding me of Jackie Chan in his heyday, the martial arts is fast and creative. Shang-chi feels really grounded and fresh for the first half of the film and it's good to move away from too much wild. But then the second half blends Asian folklore and Marvel fantasy to truly deliver a spectacle. Without having to explain itself too deeply the consistent nods to Dr Strange remind you that other dimensions exist and people can bend powers in believable ways.

Whilst it may not have needed to go so far onto fantasy, any true Marvel fan knows this is just another tuesday. The performances are strongly delivered and Shang-Chi is likely to become a new fan favourite.",3 September 2021

Vis-Captain,9,Fantastic story that pulled me in every step of the way,"I don't give 10/10 stars on most things but this was close. The thing that makes this different from a bunch of other superhero movies is that halfway through the movie I was already invested in the characters. Most origin movies focus on one or two characters to make you understand where they're coming from to prepare you for the sequel. But in this it was clear that the characters were all people with great depth. Comparing this to other marvel origin movies I would say that this one takes the cake, each and every one on one fight scene felt so tense and also like a dance. The cinematography was also brilliant, I could tell what characters were thinking and how they felt from angles and hue alone. I also really enjoyed how the movie wasn't all about Shang-Chi but it was also about all the other characters in his life and how they related to the situations they were in with him. With all this said I have to say that my favourite part was how invested I felt with several of the characters, I could understand the villains, Shang-Chi, and all the other main cast. They made it clear what they were thinking sometimes without any words, or saying something else.

Thankfully,I'm not. Just wow. I've been longing for that wow factor from the cinema since cinemas have reopened and this film gave me everything I wanted.

Take away the fact that I am biased towards Marvel movies (guilty) this however is just a fanboy loving that Marvel have delivered once again, by that I mean top tier movies in the realms of Black Panther, Thor 3, GOTG, Infinity wars, Spider-Man just to name a few.

From not having any major comic runs, to coming to our screens with this is jaw dropping movie, I can only show nothing but pure joy. From the culture, the mythical folklore, the mix of past/present and let's not forget the secret garden this film expands on the Marvel universe once again with an even deeper history.

This film gave me real belly laughs, real emotional moment, a fantastic soundtrack to match this is a genuine winner for this year and Spider-Man may have his hands full beating what I can only describe as the best introduction to a unknown character since BP/GOTG. Shang-Chi needs to be a new staple in the Marvel franchise with new stories moving forward. Not to mention that fantastic performance from Simu Liu which has genuinely made me yearn for more of his portrayal!

What an absolute treat and I've only watched it twice with a third viewing feeing more needed as the days go on.

educallejero,5,Questionable script (and Awkwafina is just the worst),"The characters are a bit incoherent and straight up contradict their own characterizations at times, because the plot needs them to do it. There are a bunch of unneeded ""deux-ex machina"" or conveniences because the writers trapped themselves into corners for no reason (that's what happens when you get the 2021 ""Mortal Kombat"", ""WW84"" and ""The Expendables"" writers).

Also, we have Awkwafina destroying every type of scene (dramatic; epic; and also the comedic ones) with one of the worst ""acting"" I've ever seen and a same type of joke (""awkward nonsense"") over and over, from start to finish, with a role ridiculously large for a dumb comic relief.

But... Liu is actually pretty good as a lead (and his character is potentially great), and the ""Shang-Chi world"" is beautiful and it has everything to be super fun to watch in the future...without Awkwafine and better writers.",14 September 2021
cornerofspace,8,A very good action flick before it was overtaken by CGI.,"The action is the movie's biggest selling point. The hand to hand combat is done exceptionally well and the use of the environment and camera movement added to the flow and intensity of each scene.

Character development and interactions is also fine. The only criticism I have is how the final fight got a bit too CGI-heavy. It really didn't need the super fantastical elements and definitely took away the character development the story was building up to. It kind of just felt like the higher-ups said a Marvel movie needs something grandiose despite the rest of the film was kept grounded.

Other than this, and the fact that a side character was able to pull a MVP hit out of thin air, the movie is very enjoyable. There is some truly breathtaking scenes and there's plenty of memorable martial arts scenes to go around. Growing up with these kung fu movies, I think you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",10 September 2021

avinca-21770,9,The same but different,"When watching Shang- Chi you will almost immediately see that it follows the same formula as every other marvel movie, but there is one thing that this movie excels at and that is the choreography. The choreography is some of the best seen in the the marvel universe and maybe even in cinema in general. The character of Shang- chi (played by Simu Liu) is a great addition to the MCU, but I can not say the same for some of the other characters in the movie especially the character Katy.(played by Awkwafina). The character is very flat and childish making her almost annoying though I believe that this is the fault of the writers and not Awkwafina. Another aspect of this movie that I like is the cameos, while I will not mention them to avoid spoilers, I will say that they are definitely one of my favorite parts of not only this movie but of the MCU in general. All in all I give Shang-chi a 9 out of 10. Great movie.",9 September 2021
southdavid,8,8 Rings out of 10,"For the first time in a couple of years, since 2019's ""Captain Marvel"" the MCU introduces us to a brand new hero. Simu Liu who, rather impressively, first asked for the role on Twitter brings us Shang-Chi in a film that perhaps does have some issues with it's ending, but ultimately is a fun, funny ride of the type Marvel have been perfecting for the last 13 years.

Talented, but somewhat aimless, Shaun (Simu Liu) lives in San Francisco working as a valet with his friend Katy (Awkwafina). When he's attacked on a bus, he's forced back into the world of his father, a ruthless terrorist Xu Wenwu (Tony Chiu-Wai Leung). First visiting his sister, then returning to the Ten Rings compound, Shang-Chi decides to use his skills to defend his late mothers sacred homeland against invasion from his father and for control of ten mystical arm rings, weapons that grant their owner immortality and unearthly power.

If ""Black Widow"" was considered a wobble for the MCU, despite the fact I thought that it's a perfectly fine film, then it was important to come back with something that was undeniably excellent. ""Shang-Chi"" was that. It's the perfect balance of humour and action that Marvel have established over the last few years. The action too is tweaked slightly, to more closely resemble the types of Asian led action films that we've seen previously, be that the Jackie Chan style bus fight, or the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-esque flashback fight between Shang Chi's parents. There's some lovely links to the wider MCU, including a return for Benedict Wong's Wong and for Trevor Slattery, Ben Kingsley's ""Iron Man 3"" character whose masquerading role as The Mandarin was one of the MCU's most divisive moments.

It's not perfect. The ending is perhaps a little rushed and lacking a moment or two of redemption earning for Xu Wenwu, but the peaks at the future for the character, and for the 10 Rings organisation is an interesting addition, plus our first real step on what might be the route to the next big bad. Excellent stuff.",9 September 2021

chitreshgupta,10,"A beautiful film in every way, shape, and form","'Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings' is absolutely on my list of favorite Marvel movies. 2021 has been full of hyped up films that have ultimately left me disappointed, but this one lives up to every bit of its hype.

The action from beginning to end was some of the best I've seen in a Marvel movie or in general in a very long time. The choreography, especially when performed by Michelle Yeoh, Meng'er Zhang, and Fala Chen (and stunt doubles) felt like poetry in motion. Everything was done with so much grace and elegance that I did not want it to end. Simu Liu brought both charisma and charm as Shang-Chi while delivering some amazing action sequences too. He was nothing short of fitting for the role. And to my surprise ""Awkwafina"" was not as unbearable as I assumed she would be.

The movie does lose some momentum in the 3rd act as it slows down a bit and takes a deeper dive into the story, but quickly picks back up as you head into the final battle. The set and CGI used creates some breathtaking shots that adds to the greatness of the film.

Marvel fan or not this film is worth going to see.",9 September 2021
rick-jatti,9,a gorgeous movie,"Shang-Chi has instantly entered my top 5 of Marvel movies. There is so much to adore about this movie. The visuals are beautiful, the villain is compelling, the last sequence isn't very predictable, as superhero movies can often be. The characters all have a level of depth that is often missing from the supporting characters in superhero movies, and I was pleased that they didn't marginalize Xialing as it would've been easy to do. I don't know much about the different disciplines of martial arts, but it seems very similar to Avatar: The Last Airbender in how they drew inspiration from different real world fighting styles for different fighters in the movie. If I compare the acting to the other movies I consider the best to produced by Marvel (Infinity War, Ragnarok, Winter Soldier, etc.), Shang-Chi is a notch below, but it blows every other Marvel movie out of the water when it comes to action and choreography. The bus scene in the first act has easily become my favorite sequence in any Marvel film. Origin films often fall into the same traps, but Shang-Chi doesn't, maybe because many didn't know much about the character. But even so, typical tropes like training sequences were done better in Shang-Chi, and the story didn't linger on his youth too much.",9 September 2021

sirwillisiv,8,A solid superhero adventure...,"Like many, I was concerned that this new Marvel Cinematic Universe saga would have trouble living up to previous standards but Shang-Chi has already left me hopeful for the series' future. I literally know nothing about this character but I found his film debut to be a solid superhero adventure; well acted, effectively character-driven, occasionally funny, rich with cultural representation and booming with swift and stylized martial arts action. It has what I hoped I was going to get from Black Panther: inclusivity AND an interesting world and narrative. I'm 100% all for representation but the story and characters must be pronounced, too and I just found this entry to be a lot more distinguished and captivating.

Although Shang-Chi treads the familiar origin story formula, there's a few fresh twists and turns that uniquely sets this character's journey apart from the others. Though the first half is decently entertaining with some identifiable drama and fast-paced yet slightly derivative set-pieces in urban environments, the second half is where the film really turns on (at least for me). The Chinese philosophy kicks in, the mythology is abundant, there's tons of visually striking imagery, a fantastical setting, loads of insane action choreography. The Asian representation is just off the chain and I was so enraptured by it. It doesn't feel contrived, I sensed a great deal of respect for it and all the while an engaging story was unfolding. A nice balance. I was very satisfied with what I saw. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of Shang-Chi's world and how it'll tie in with other stories yet-to-come. Very cool movie.

-the romance scene was soo beautiful with both shang-chi mother & father a better romance movie than other marvel superhero movie lol.

-the landscapes & background graphics were so amazing well done! It is soo enjoying to see a beautiful landscapes of grass, trees, & with chinese mythology creatures.

-the funny scene was really enjoyable to watch with mostly KATY !! Shang-chi close friend lol.

-the storyline was 4 main character was SHANG-CHI, XIALING, WENWU, & JIANG LI. It was a very well done well written story line plot of these 4 main characters by showing flashbacks to the past of what had happened to these 4 characters.

-the script was well done some had some serious scripts as WENWU,XIALING & SHANG-CHI but only 2 has the funny scripts as KATY & TREVOR SLATTERY! Lmao.

-2 villains that work for WENWU was very well done made with their own job to do which was Razor-fist & Death dealer...

shawnyu64,9,Pleasantly surprised!,"Didn't have high hope before going in because neither Simu nor Awkwafina was a superhero movie casting material, and Mandarin is a very controversial villain of choice, but I was pleasantly surprised on how good Shang-Chi was.

The chemistry between Simu and Awkwafina was exceptional, and Tony Leung's casting of Not-Mandarin aka Xu Wenwu was not just amazing, but one of the best villains Marvel has ever seen. It's a villain whose motivation is actually both believable and relatable. Oh, and the actual ""Mandarin"" was also a comical gold.

Plus, fighting scenes were absolutely amazing. First half's martial art scenes were on par with some martial arts classics and later half of, well, typical Marvel CGI stuff were quite of eye candies.

virpatwardhan,9,Shang - Chi Movie Review,"Marvel Studios has gained a glamorous reputation throughout the last decade, and this film was a huge milestone for superhero cinema, Asian representation, and the studio as a whole. Like Black Panther was to a lot of African-American audiences, Shang-Chi will ignite a spark in the hearts of Asians. This film opens the door to a relatable character and I love Simu-Liu's portrayal of Shang-Chi. I have watched Simu previously in the show Kim's Convenience as a comedic character and there couldn't have been better casting for Shang-Chi. Simu reflects the combination of an Asian-American character superbly and has an amazing screen presence. His character reminded me of Captain America because of his leadership role in the film, standing up against all odds, and overall amazing chemistry with the rest of the cast. Awkwafina's character, Katie, was an amazing character, filled with comedic relief that gave a lighter tone, to a film that was a little bit too dark for a Marvel film. Tony Leung's character, The Mandarin stole the show with a vengeance. Tony Leung is absolutely ground-breaking in every role he plays and The Mandarin was a unique role he took on. Leung had an amazing screen presence and was my character in the film. The visual effects in the film were unique and I could see that the animators had taken inspiration from traditional Chinese films regarding Martial Arts, also having similarities in design to Doctor Strange. The action in this film was mind-blowing like I was expecting, and I loved the fight on the bus. The soundtrack was average, with the usage of traditional Chinese instruments. The songs used in the film were composed by primarily Chinese Hip-Hop artists and I enjoyed them. The writing in this film was good, but not great. One of the criticisms I have about the film is that the plot did not feel original and could've been executed far better. There were a lot of parts in the middle of the film that stole away from the central plot of the film. This film had a more emphasis on magic and fantasy as suppose Kung Fu. Overall, this film is hands down one of the best gems Marvel has produced, and I cannot wait for Shang-Chi to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe further.",6 September 2021

sweidman-28016,8,Refreshing and Captivating!,"""I gave you ten years to live your life. And where did that get you? You walked in my shadow.""

Marvel Studios' Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings follows Shang-Chi, a seemingly ordinary young man from San Francisco who parks cars for a living alongside his friend, as must confront the past he thought he left behind when he is drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization. Marvel took a big chance on this project. Of course we've had lesser known heroes end up getting their own movie franchise within the MCU, but Shang-Chi is not one many know about. Little was known going in other than we'd get some action scenes and explore new territory within the MCU. What they managed to do with Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is unlike any Marvel movie yet. Destin Daniel Cretton takes a new approach that works wonders. His previous works of Short Term 12 and Just Mercy are heartfelt dramas so something big like this is new territory, but he incorporates the same style and messages into this. The dysfunctional family dynamic serving as the character arc and forming the conflict is so much deeper than some random business guy who wants to rule the world. With this story, it's easy to connect with it and understand character motives. I will say there's a lot to pack in here and the story can get muddy at points, but it pulls itself together that we retain most of everything.

Simu Liu is fantastic in the title role. Previous to watching, I hadn't seen him in anything. But he has all the skills as an emerging actor to be a household name. Shang-Chi is an interesting character to follow. As he discovers and recalls moments from his upbringing, we can slowly piece him together. There's much more to be made from him, but with future installments we'll be able to get much more. And Tony Chiu-Wai Leung is perfectly cast as Xu Wenwu. He's a villain I can understand, like, and dislike all at the same time. He's flawed, but there's depth to him. And he almost steals the show by the end with another showcase of mad acting skills. But the character I've been thinking of a lot, and mainly because she was so hilarious, is Awkwafina as Katy. Awkwafina is one of my favorite actresses working right now, especially after her role in The Farewell, and she smashes this. Katy is the typical comedic sidekick but so much fun. One of the funniest jokes comes from her and I was laughing hysterically. Maybe more character will come from her later, but what we got was enough for me. I can't wait to see her again! I should also mention Meng'er Zhang as Xialing. This is her first role and she's also great. What they'll do with her next should be interesting.

From a technical standpoint, this is impressive for a Marvel movie. There are some stunning visuals. The cinematography isn't that gray color scheme used in most, though it does fall into that later on, and bursting with color. And as you probably know, the visual effects are as good as they come. It's not muddled with CGI and a scene that was completely green screen, which is nice to see. Also, Marvel has been doing great with the themes and score lately because this is another great one, along with the soundtrack. Paired with this are the best fight scenes out of the whole MCU. The stunt choreography is top notch and is beautiful and intense to look at. The bus scene early on is the best yet and will be hard to top! Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings just really did it for me and most everybody can agree. It's refreshing and captivating in every way. Marvel has been taking some big leaps with this new phase and it gets me more and more excited for each new installment!",8 September 2021

nidhunmoviebuff,9,Another fabulous addition to MCU's Phase 4!,"The much-awaited Shangi Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings released today in theatres. It follows the journey of Shang Chi (Simu Liu), the son of the famed MCU villain the Mandarin, who revolts against his father to fight evil.

The first stand-alone film featuring an Asian American superhero, Shang Chi understandably stands out with its close combat sequences. All the actors and especially Simu Liu have undergone extensive martial arts training and it shows, with a sensational sequence on a moving bus in San Francisco and another on a bamboo scaffolding in Macau, the standouts.

Awkwafina and a surprise returning character from the MCU provide genuine, sarcasm-laced comedy that adds another wonderful layer to the experience. Cameos from Benedict Wong and Ronnie Chieng also manage to leave the audience in spits.

Without stooping to cultural appropriation, with an all-Asian crew, director Destin Daniel Cretton pays rich tribute to Chinese heritage at every turn. Hong Kong's superstars Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh are electric in their roles and the fact that they don't seem to have lost a step with age, acing their action sequences, shows their dedication as performers.

Regarded as one of the finest actor's Chinese cinema has every produced, Tony Leung stamps his class all over the film, giving an engrossing, captivating performance as the dreaded leader of the Ten Rings.

His inner moral dilemmas and love/hate relationship with his children are portrayed brilliantly by the man nicknamed 'Small Tiger' among the Five Tiger Generals of Hong Kong Cinema

The flashback sequences help to build up Shang Chi as a character and intricately captures his upbringing as the heir-apparent to a genocidal megalomaniac, and how despite wanting nothing to do with his father's murderous tendencies, as his son, he is inadvertently drawn to the Mandarin's world of violence and carnage.

The films delves into mystical elements towards the climax and with two surprise-laden post-credit sequences tie into both Doctor Strange's world of Mystic Arts as well as a possible connection that the Ten Rings has to alien technology.

As always, the way weaves in each individual fim character to the wonderful tapestry that makes up each of its Phases is a joy in itself.

It is due to the well-written characters and the nuanced acting of its performers that Shang Chi stands out while the eye-catching CGI and elaborately chorographer action sequences add more gloss to the end product.

Another wonderful new addition to the MCU world and hopefully this paves the way for more ethnicities being represented in the universe as time goes on.

Highly recommended. A must watch. Marvel's Phase 4 continues to raise the bar!",4 September 2021

jliao27,10,Wonderful,"I had read the advance reviews and was excited about the positivity and glowing feedback I'd seen. It means a lot to Asian-Americans to finally be put in the spotlight, and by a juggernaut like the Marvel machine no less.

Went to see a late night showing on Thursday, Sept 2nd, technically a day in advance of the official release date. Happy to say the movie did not disappoint. I've watched so many Hong Kong style movies over the years and the Shang-Chi film-making team did a spectacular job of importing that authentic, Asian-flavor of film-making. They did the kind of research I've come to expect from Marvel's creative team, and let this team leave their own distinct Chinese style from using Mandarin-speaking dialogue in strategic moments, to the very distinct style of Chinese-influenced music (totally awesome!), and the kung-fu sequences on the scaffolding, which is something you see in many of the old school Kung Fu movies. Michelle Yeoh, in particular, acted in many a movie in this vein back many years ago.

The filmmakers did a great job of melding old-style, Authentic Chinese Kung Fu cinema and themes (father-son tension, motherly devotion, male prioritized over female, etc .) with current Asian-American themes (underachieving children and over-expecting parents, general confusion in American society) and combining everything in the context of a fantasy-action movie with trademark Marvel humor to lighten things up.

I was a fan of the special effects throughout the movie, and thoroughly enjoyed the ending sequence as well. Like other reviewers, I loved the opening fight sequence between Tony Leung and Fala Chen. It's wonderful to see that Tai Chi - style of fighting introduced in a Western, blockbuster movie.

Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was a great movie but with Shang-Chi, I think Marvel achieved something more in melding disparate parts and taking on much more in bringing together cultures, generations and viewpoints in the context of a MCU superhero action movie. The next time we see Shang-Chi, there's no doubt most of us - moviegoers of all colors and cultures - we will be happy to see him again.",3 September 2021

ProbablyHuman,6,A disappointment: predictable and shallow,"The movie's CGI and action sequences were top tier, but the story and writing, the most important parts of a film, were predictable and simplistic.

Character motives were shallow and stereotypical and I was not emotionally invested in the family or any individual character. Once you understand that the movie is about family, which you can pick up right away, the plot, conflicts, and resolution are entirely predictable.

The movie had its classic Marvel funny moments (diffusing tense moments with surprising humor), but I cringed in plenty of scenes too. This movie had a poor ending with little emotional catharsis. The ultimate conflict was resolved with CGI, magic, and deus ex machinas, like the average action blockbuster, which might have been acceptable if it had emotional depth or moral complexity, but it didn't.

Overall, the movie was a typical superhero film about family bonds with Kung Fu and dragons. As much as I love the Chinese representation, as I am Chinese, the movie itself was disappointing.",5 September 2021

VINDETTAUS,9,Created an account just to review this.,"I was really looking forward to this movie. Initially, I was a bit upset that I wasn't going to be able to watch it on Disney+. However, after experiencing it on the big screen, I was so thankful I HAD to go to my local theatre to watch it. As a Chinese Australian, you rarely get to see characters that are similar to you. It was so nice to see asian experiences displayed unapologetically on the screen. The reviews that discuss how next level the martial arts are, really were telling the truth. I have seen plenty of Chinese dramas where martial arts is displayed full on & I always found myself thinking the filming direction was a bit off. This movie combined martial arts from the Chinese dramas & it was so natural and perfectly impactful. It is definitely not like the action shown in 2020's Mulan. The SFX was STUNNING, it's better than what the other Marvel movies have shown & we were just amazed at the effort and details that were placed.

I'm no acting major so I don't know my stuff but I did find some of Simu Liu's facials to be a tad awkward or a little too exaggerated however, he was still, nonetheless, wonderful in this role. Tony Leung, my god, he was the moment. He really shone in this movie for me. His natural swag & cool demeanour was so attractive and I really could not hate his character. I enjoyed Awkwafina's acting in this movie, she really knows how to deliver humorous lines & I'm glad she had an impactful part in the movie & wasn't just the comedy relief.

It did hurt to see that my cinema wasn't packed especially since my area is full of Asians. They may have not known about the movie since Marvel barely did any advertisement for it. I definitely hope in the future I get to see more support for Shang-Chi & the other members.

Regarding the credit scenes: the mid credits scene was definitely a ""huh, that's interesting"" moment but probably not something to cause any uproar over. I'm interested to see where it goes.

Overall, I REALLY enjoyed this movie. There was so much Mandarin incorporated in the movie that I am able to take my parents to watch it too!",1 September 2021
cruise01,10,"Epic, stunning, and a strong powerhouse story.","5 out of 5 stars.

Shang-Chi and the legend of the Ten Rings is an awesome and exciting mcu film that brings the stunning world with the asian culture. I will say i enjoyed this more than the previous mcu film Black Widow. Shang Chi introduces a new mcu character played by Simu Liu. And Awkwafina which is also a fun addition. While they are being chased by an organization called ten rings. Lead by his father Tony Leung. While Shang Chi learns his abilities and the ten rings. Before his father is trying to use that power for a personal reason.

Great epic plot. Shang Chi and Katy (Awkwafina) enter a hidden world Ta Lao where there is magical mythical creatures. Is like a wow stunning moment when you first see Wakanda in Black Panther. The film does give an emotional story build up and a villain that can be relatable.

The cast ensemble is great. Simu Liu did great with the character along with Awkwafina as his friend. Meng'er Zhang, Michelle Yeoh, Benedict Wong, Florian Munteanu, and Tong Leung all did great.

The set designs and visual effects are stunning and great. Can be colorful at moments. The music score was good as well. The action sequences are great and exciting. Every set piece had an awesome martial arts choreography which was well shot with the cinematography. Director did a great job in capturing the action and fight sequences. Even with the epic climax of the dragon battle.

There are two mid and post credit scene which sets up for further films and has a fun nod to the mcu.

I will say Shang Chi is a great exciting addition and i found the film to be very fast moving. Action packed. And a great family conflict story that is emotionally driven.",3 September 2021

Simu Liu gives an incredible and extremely charismatic lead performance whilst also having superb chemistry with Awkwafina, who is also incredible. Michelle Yeoh and Meng'er Zhang are both great and Tony Leung is amazing as one of the better villains in the MCU with plenty of backstory and depth.

aidanratesmovies,9,"A fun time at the movies, and that's all it really needed to be","Charming and incredibly fun- Shang-Chi may not be the best Marvel has had to offer- but it is one of their better films in some time. My main problems with the film lie in the films storyline, which to be honest, is really good, but incredibly all over the place editing wise and there is just so much of it that it feels like two movies could have been made out of it. I love that we get a more in depth look at our characters, their flaws, their regrets, the tragedy in their lives- but the editing makes it feel rather out of place at times- and takes away from the impact the film could have had and its heart. That being said, the film still manages to be very enjoyable throughout. The action scenes are absolutely incredible, the look of the film incredibly well developed- something very fresh and original for Marvel studios- and the cast are all a joy to watch- especially Simu Liu and Aquafina in the lead and supporting roles. I was skeptical of Aquafina being in a Marvel movie for sure, but she really helped the film as a whole, and honestly I would love to see more of her character in future Marvel projects. The film is entertaining, despite the pacing of the film being a bit all over the place at times. It has some brilliant, elaborate special effects that you will be gawking at on the screen, and plenty of surprises that will be bound to make you smile. In the end, Shang-Chi was a fun time for a Marvel movie- something most comic-book flicks have forgotten about recently- and i'm excited what this character has to offer in future films.

Beautiful cinematography and the choreography was more than just stunt work. Acting a little rough here and there, the protagonist actor did a pretty good job though. That dry MCU humor we've grown to see didn't quite hit. I know a lot of people wished they would have done much more with Mandarin as he is a pretty big bad in the comics and they hyped him up a lot. But I think this movie just makes people excited for THE NEXT marvel movie rather than truly giving this MCU story life. And with the movie being 2 hours long, it felt so rushed and at the same time most viewers were waiting for it to just end.

It's as if you tried to first sprint, then suddenly halt and tip-toe-walk and then run a marathon only to sprint again.

Second issue are flashbacks. This movie is riddled with them. And I don't mind them.. Unless they keep on returning to exactly the same scene over and over and over again with that difference that you get to listen to new part of the talk. I don't remember any other movie that was so riddled with flashbacks.

Third issue are fights. Now this has to be broken in 2 groups; ""magical fights"" and ""down to earth fights"". The first was done terribly. Camera shake, way too close, badly lighted and confusing as heck. There was some vision, some idea, yes, but it turned into ""cgi slosh"". This could have been done oh-so-much better.. But we got pointless confusing close-ups then camera shaky-shaky moments instead. The second group reminds me of jackie chan movies, you know.. kung-fu stuff, which was great... To some extend.

Fourth issue is main character. He's the extend from point earlier. He's like blank-slate punching bag in this show. He has no real emotions and just goes with the flow. He >never< speaks his mind and rather just silently mumbles his agreement for whatever plan others come up with. It was annoying. Really grating. Ok, I don't mind if MC is not an iron man of a character. But I had seen corpses put more action while being decomposing than Shang chi. Also he gets beaten pretty much all the time. There are only 3'ish exceptions where he shows real emotions. And again.. shoddy pacing cripples them slightly.

The Second character, his friend - Katey (i think).. she was fine. She was active and I couldn't shake this feeling that she's the brains of the team with witty humor, while he's broody muscle man with past.

There were few amazing scenes, which i loved alot, really. But beyond that it was just mediocre. Thank god it was ""just"" mediocre, considering what things marvel relases lately. Mediocre is fine. Really. Tiresome, extended to the point of exhausting... But fine! A (not so) solid 7!

Oh also, there are quite a few plot holes and whatnot ranging from minor (assassins using stun weapons ONLY - lol) to extreme (spoilery stuff).. but at this point.. i just can't even bother. Just roll my eyes and force my brain to stop thinking about it. To become a script writer in 202x all you need to know is how to sniff glue with class and how to agree to everything corporate monkeys in expensive suits tell you.

Should you watch it? If Marvel fan.. you already seen it. If you aren't marvel fan, but still enjoy sci-fi/fantasy... Eh... Not like there's anything better to do I guess.",15 September 2021

mdhumayonkabir,7,The story is good but there is problems with other aspects of this movie.,"The best aspects of this movie is hand to hand combats(without the rings) and Simu Liu is awesome in it and embraces the character. The story is good if consider standalone which it is but I have problems with other aspects of movie elements. The entire movie is shooted in closed studio environment with huge set pieces (Marvel is doing such things for last many movies e.g, the last 2 Avengers movies). It is very very very stupid to look at and the non sensical vfx. Still remember the first Iron man movie in which the original and vfx elements are hard to distinguish and have had a good balance in reality and fantasy world. The movie is forcing the humours too in some cases. In some case they tried to mimic Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This movie certainly have some asian vibe in movie making style but I think there were manipulation in making by studio over creator. The music of the movie is good. Overall it's a good movie. I am going to give any special attention for other upcoming marvel movies( Maybe because I left behind my fantasy world). I think there will not be any 'Classic' from marvel in upcoming future.",12 September 2021

The performances of Simu Liu and Tony Leung stand out amongst the pack and offer a great and rich story for Marvels Cinematic Universe. Though the film can at times feel bogged down by its origin story tropes, the direction of Destin Daniel Cretton, the overall charm of its cast, and story make the film feel fresh and lively.

The action and fights scenes seemed very well choreographed and the special effects were a joy to experience on the big screen.

It was a Marvel film that didn't feel like a Marvel film, which shows how versatile the MCU is becoming.

I was highly impressed to see and hear characters speak in their native language, a risk as many people don't like to read subtitles, but being an avid fan of Asian cinema I was quite happy and comfortable to do so.

Overall, a highly entertaining and fun film from Marvel.

I highly recommend it. A+++",9 September 2021
dan_slentz,7,Excellent Movie.. Stands on it's own without seeing any others.,"""Reel Tunez: The Radio Show All About the Movies"" Movie Review (9/8/21): ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings""

First, when people on IMDB rate a movie (though VERY good) a 9 or 10, I really want to ask ""So it's a 10.. the VERY BEST movie EVER.. as good as ""Sound of Music"", ""Gone with the Wind"", ""Oliver"", ""Star Wars"" and movies that probably DO get a 9 or 10?? To me.. YES.. an excellent movie. But people skew the ratings by calling everything a 9 or 10. With that said, I'd give it between a 7 and 8 (which is VERY good), but a little closer to a 7 (7.4).

Yet another Marvel Studio (Disney) release to the Marvel Universe. I knew nothing about this movie and didn't really have a lot of interest in seeing it, but GLAD I did! It was fun.. and it was exciting! Excellent adventure movie that had great effects and great story line.

If you like adventure movies.. even if you haven't followed the Marvel Universe, you really don't have to know the history of the other movies to enjoy this one.

I will add the following (which is not a spoiler): Do NOT leave the movie until the very VERY last of the credits have rolled and they turn on the lights to clean the place. As the movie ends, we go into one last restaurant scene. Then in the middle of the credits, we get MORE story. Then after the last of the credits.. even after ""Marvel Studio Cleaning Crew: Bob the Janitor and Mae his wife"", we get ONE more scene at the end. These Marvel extras are consistent and basically a clue into what comes next.

On a 1-10 scaled, I'd give this a very good 7.4! This is a BIG screen movie, so see it at the theater.",9 September 2021

kaskuserlie,10,"Fun, Exciting, Culture Rich","Its was great, finally after so long we got to experience good origins story. I know kevin feige will nailed it even after lot of people thought its gonna flop.

The movie is like a mixture between western and eastern culture afterall the protagonist is an asian living in american.

The raw choreography is the best in the MCU, better than Winter Soldier. The CGI fights is not bad but i think they should do more of the raw realistic fight scene more because its the most appealing part of the movie.

Tony Leung is so charismatic even if he is a villain, i can feel sympathetic to his character. The new mythology is cool, the fantastic beast is awesome too I hope we can see a sequels.",8 September 2021
erikahawj-22103,10,It was more than I expected!,"As an Asian-American, I am no stranger to the cliche martial art scenes and corniness of it all. I went in fully expecting everything about this movie to be cheesy and cliche like Mulan was. Boy, was I wrong! Shang-Chi was so beautifully written, acted, and directed! I really want to give a huge shout out to the directors for their incorporation of Asian culture into this movie without making everything a cliche or a punch-line. I teared up watching people who looked like me be the main actors on a big screen and not the punch-line of a joke.

Now, onto the story, the story was alright. It wasn't the best, but it's an introductory movie to the hero so not much to expect there other than your typical hero introductory tropes.

The OST's of this movie were off the charts! I really enjoyed the music they had and think they nailed it.

Need I say more about the acting? Tony Leung, Sima Liu, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh...These are the best of the best for Asian American actors and they nailed every scene they had in the movie!

Lastly, I absolutely loved the cinematography and the fight scenes. They were well thought out and choreographed. It didn't seem cheesy or corny. Thank you Marvel for making this movie and paying homage to Asian Americans. This movie will be one that I will never forget!",7 September 2021
torgis,10,My new favourite origin,"All I can say is ""wow"". I loved the cinematography, I was amazed by the choreography and the fact it wasn't hidden or obscured through camera angles like some previous movies, and I now love Simu Liu and think he is an incredible addition to the MCU, along with Awkwafina.

The ""villain"" of the story, Wenwu, played by the amazing Tony Leung, had incredible character depth and was certainly not a stereotypical bad guy.

Aside from a couple of awkward phrases, I loved everything about this movie and am so glad I was able to support it during their opening weekend. If it wasn't COVID, I would've went to see it again by now. Highly recommend.",7 September 2021

shivnarang,10,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is like a poetry in motion.,"This movie is a blast and then some. It is, just like Black Panther was, a Marvel movie and it's own thing at the same time. It brings a much needed freshness to MCU. The story is about Shang-Chi, a Kung Fu fighter, who is forced to confront his past after being drawn into the Ten Rings organization. Is this the same Ten Rings organization from Iron Man and Iron Man 3? I'll let the movie explain.

Director Destin Daniel Cretton successfully blends in his culture in the Marvel format, but also keeps it real, authentic and most importantly communicates a very personal story effectively. At the heart of it, this is a movie about a dysfunctional family dealing with their family drama. I'm not going to talk about what the drama is as that will be a spoiler. But with that drama comes some of the best Kung-Fu fights I've seen on the big screen in a long time.

Simu Liu as Shang-Chi and Awkwafina as his best friend are well known stars, but after this movie they will be upgraded to superstar status. They were brilliant in the movie and were yin to each other's yang. Where Simu Liu brought the punches, Awkwafina brought. The punchlines. They complimented each other to create the perfect balance. Another character that left an impression on me is Tony Chiu-Wai Leung as Shang-Chi's father. The love-hate relationship between him and Shang-Chi is relatable and just so heartbreaking.

Rest of the star cast is also brilliantly casted and this movie has some of the best written supporting characters. The core group consists of Fala Chen as Shang-Chi's mother who is the soul of this movie, Meng'er Zhang as his sister who is just as much of a kick ass as Shang-Chi and Michelle Yeoh as his aunt who becomes his guide and teacher. There is also a surprise character in the movie that I loved, but I am not going to talk about it and spoil it for you guys.

This is a Marvel product so you know that the VFX & CGI are industry best. Adding to that are the beautiful Cinematography and the fast paced Camera Work. Each and every fight sequence is meticulously handled and spectacularly choreographed. You have seen some of the bus fight scenes in the trailer, but there are other high stake fight scenes that will also leave you breathless.

You knew you were going to watch this movie when it came out. My review is just to tell you that yes, it is everything you expected and wanted it to be. I personally never doubted Kevin Feige. Now go watch this movie and let it knock your socks off.

P. S. - This movie has a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene, so make sure you catch those.",5 September 2021

We have entered into Phase 4 of the greatest movie franchise in movie history. We have seen battles, we have seen so many Marvel characters in the last 12 years come to life, but this new kind of hero comes to us by surprise.

Who here knows about Shang-Chi? I just learned about on Friday and from what I read - I can honestly tell you his story is one for the history books. I can't give out the whole movie to you or anything to spoil the movie, but this movie was different from the other movies in the MCU.

I was in shock from the very beginning to the end, there were a lot of ""easter eggs"" linking all the way back to Tony Stark, oops, I think I said a little too much, but I will say this - This movie defied everything in the natural and supernatural realm of not only the physical, but the soul. It dives deep into the soul of a person, and that is what Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is all about.

I have to give a huge shout-out to Simu Liu - like I said before - I have never heard of Shang-Chi up until recently, but he gave the role a new meaning and a new identity.

Now without giving too much away, with every Marvel movie, there are some credit scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat. That's all I am saying.

So in essence - I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings: 11 stars.",5 September 2021

sujanfaster,8,The New Normal (MARVEL),"After a brief gap of theatrical release (not considering Black Widow as it had a partial release), MARVEL is back in theatres introducing to the characters of the new phase of their universe. Shang Chi The Legend Of Ten Rings is a standalone film but equally also serves as an important piece of puzzle in the events linking to the web series' and upcoming movies. It goes without saying that watching all the recently released series on Disney+ is as important as following these movies in order.

As the trailer shows and also the name suggests Shang Chi is a movie whose action heavily lean towards the martial arts and individual battles. It is a different watch as compared to other MARVEL movies which involve a lot of hi tech dependent action. The movie hardly wastes any time on the lead character's introduction and straightway jumps into the 'purpose'. Having experienced the 'blip' after the infinity war, the normal people aren't surprised anymore when supernatural things and high octane action happens around them. Hence the character here is hardly wasting any time on hiding their identities from the public. The storyline is pretty straightforward and the movie has strong resemblance to Black Panther because of the lead character's connection to his place of origin. The action sequences are shot brilliantly and some of the camera and lighting work is mind blowing. The movie relies on good hand to hand combat almost until the climax and I believe if MARVEL had gone for an R rating, the action sequences would have been much better to watch. I personally think some incidents happening around climax were way too convenient. Last but not the least, the background music just elevates most scenes into a whole new level.

Simu Liu has what it takes to bring the Asian heritage to the superhero universe. The movie doesn't test much of his emotional side and I believe we will get to see more in the upcoming movies. Tony Leung shines in his powerful antagonist role and Awkwafina drives the comical side of things as Shang Chi's close buddy who is almost a sidekick. Rest of the cast have done a decent job and do look out for a surprise funny cameo ;-)

MARVEL expands its universe with Shang Chi by exploring a different culture and heritage in the superhero genre. It is a satisfying watch for a MARVEL fan and a great watch for any action movie fans.",4 September 2021
HonestGabe,9,Tradition Meets Modern,"I was blown away by the great storyline from start to finish, amazing choreography, stunning visuals, and surreal locales.

Bek204,8,"""Is this what you wanted?""","Shang Chi and the legend of the ten rings introduces a new Marvel Character/Avenger, and that's Shang-Chi. The way that the film introduced that character was great. Loved how the film jumps back and forth a few times to tell us about Shang-Chi's past when he was young and how or why he ended up where he is in the present day.

The film had so many fight scenes that were amazing and the cinematography that was used to shoot these fight scenes made them 10x better and that's perhaps because the cinematographer of this film is Bill Pope who shot The Matrix (1999) and Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 (2004). You could tell for sure that there are a lot of similarities between the fight scenes in Shang-Chi and The Matrix especially that both of them had this ""kung fu"" style of fighting. Loved how sometimes during the fight scenes the ""Dutch tilt"" method was used and it was wide showing the stunning set design around.

The film is also visually stunning which I'm happy to call one of Marvel's most visually stunning films. It's a treat for the eyes.

The comedy in the film was so good and used very carefully in perfect times which is something that scares me whenever I watch a ""Marvel"" film. Because these films are supposed to be ""serious superhero"" films. But, when comedy is used in perfect times, the result will be perfect.

Akwafina's acting was very great. Loved her character and am excited to see what her character will have in future MCU Films. Simu Liu was of course the perfect actor for this role but one thing that in my opinion he ""failed at"" are the ""emotional scenes"". This film has so many emotional scenes that discuss ""family"" and the relationship between a father and his son. I felt like Simu Liu couldn't be able to deliver that emotional feeling to the audience because his acting was bad in these emotional scenes. This brings me to Tony Chiu-Wai Leung who plays ""the father"". Leung carried the whole film in my opinion. Whenever there was an emotional scene between the father and his son, Leung was way better at expressing and showing his feelings than Simu Liu.

Loved all the visual effects, they were all well made especially that the film has so many. The customs as well are great and loved how sometimes the colors represent Shang-Chi's culture like the ""football varsity jacket"" that was red and grey that Shang-Chi was wearing at the beginning of the film.

I got to point out that the last 30 minutes or so of the film are one of the greatest and most enjoyable in the whole MCU.

Here's a little tip for the people who wrote this: pick a tone and stick with it!

Good CGI and very good action set pieces. Hence three stars instead of one. Other than that - this is the normal generic Marvel phase 2 dross.

afrocut,8,Surprisingly good time,"I'm super happy to say that Marvels newest movie outing, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", is a hilarious, action packed, CGI thrill ride and it's a fantastic one at that. After seeing ""Black Widow"" I was worried that Marvel/Disney had started shifting their focus to their very ambitious TV mini series projects and left the quality of their movies behind. I'm now confident that isn't the case. Here, sets, visuals, costumes, choreography, score, acting and directing are all top notch. Each shot feels fresh and visually stunning. Each joke and emotion land. And the action is amazing. The first big set piece involving Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) and his best friend (awkwafina), is a bus ride to work gone horribly wrong, it hooks you instantly and has you either in awe with its incredible fight choreography or laughing at the perfectly timed jokes. It really doesn't let up in either category going forward. I can't believe how much I loved the pairing of these characters, their choice to not make it romantic and I love how different and real they feel from other characters in the MCU. Often Marvels problem has been their reliance on the same personality traits for their heroes, funny jerks with over confidence or bumbling idiots thrust into power. Here the main character is naturally a good person, hes comfortable with being himself and with his best friend, when power comes to him he accepts, he never truly stops being him, he doesn't have to learn a lesson, he just rolls with the punches. Almost all of this goes to actor Simu Liu who brings an extra dose of likability to the role, along with the chemistry he shares with Awkwafina which makes their friendship believable. There's even great references, cameos and credit scenes for the fans looking for that. Of course there are problems, the biggest is the big CGI slug fest ending that plagues these types of films, when all it truly needed to do was be smaller. It's a mess of CGI at times and feels a little too big and too rushed. Characters just instantly know and understand things and accept everything with ease. It is easy to over look all this, with how much fun you'll have.",3 September 2021
feamaral-52029,1,"Generic, excessive jokes and lazy writing",The Marvel Studios once again makes a movie that uses jokes instead of making a good character development.,5 September 2021
boblipton,6,Next Phase,"It was an okay movie. Simu Liu is the son of the seemingly immortal master of the Ten Rings --always good to see Tony Leung, and I hope he soaked Disney --who winds up opposing his dad, and Awkwafina is his slacker sort-of girlfriend. They are fine in the leads, as is Meng'er Zhang as his sister, and Michelle Yeoh as their aunt -- always good to see her, and I hope she soaked Disney too.

I have grown increasingly fond of martial arts films over the last couple of decades, and the decline of the movie musical is the reason why. They don't make movies like that any more, and when they try, they're often embarrassing. People don't like the unreality of people bursting out into song, or expressing their emotions through dance. No, they prefer the solid commonplace of people floating through space to kick each other in the head. To me, the fight choreography is its own dance, and the fight between Leung and Fala Chen when they meet and before they fall in love is a challenge dance as graceful as any between Astaire and Rogers.

There are problems aplenty with this film. There's an immense amount of exposition, starting off with twenty minutes of it in Chinese. I'm not sure why Ben Kingsley as the fake 'Mandarin' from IRON MAN 3 is present except for a certain remnant of star power and connecting this to the rest of the MCU. Still, with my expectations not set particularly high, I had a good time.",11 September 2021

It definitely did not disappoint me! This film is massive fun, massive action and has massive heart. The action scenes are so cool and the choreography is amazing in the fight scenes and the martial arts look so good. I love the jokes between the two main characters and the banter they have together is great fun. This is a good way to do an origin film this far into the MCU, it sort of flicks between flash backs and the present day and it keeps the pacing of the film fresh and quick. Shang-chi as a character isn't super well known but just like the guardians of the galaxy I think he will become a household name. The shots in this film are gorgeous at times and have some beautiful bright colours and amazing Chinese settings. Some of the effects fail a little bit but it's not enough to harm the film at all.

My only issue is the execution of the good Dragon - it's too Raya the Last Dragon meaning it's too Disney more than MCU vibe. Also, I wish I didn't watch all the too many trailers of the movie cuz you lose the surprise. The 2 post credits tho - it's fun and insane!",3 September 2021
sagniknath,4,Generic marvel movie that could have delivered so much more,"This had so much potential that got sadly wasted.

The few fight scenes in the first half were better in quality compared to the usual Marvel quick cut edited ones. They were mildly reminiscent of the Matrix fights( The intro to the Shangchi theme music even sounded suspiciously similar to Furious Angels from Matrix Reloaded and made me miss the Matrix films more)

However, anything positive about the film ends in the first half only with the second half culminating in a bloated CGI mess that is the hallmark of almost all Marvel movies. In fact, between Shangchi and Black Widow, I'd say the latter featured much better visual effects which would have looked better on the big screen than this. Shangchi would have been a more apt as a direct to video release.)

It didn't also help that the lead actor was a complete void of charisma.

Honestly, I am just going to watch some Jackie Chan movies now to now to help deal with the kung fu cravings this movie initiated in me but failed to deliver.",4 September 2021

If you are a huge Marvell fan you will like this movie or at least tolerate it.

All the rest will probably be disappointed.

bdark-39123,10,First movie in years that got me tearing up and getting goose bumps,"I watched a few Marvel movies for the humor and action, and they were never ""great"" movies to me, so I was expecting to like it but nothing else.

In the first few minutes the narrator only speaks Chinese with subtitles, which is a change from the usual immediate switch to English. At the first fighting scene I noticed how cool the music was, It's a bit like dubstep? But it really works with the scenery. Morgan Freeman's small role made me laugh, I didn't expect him there.

I was also not expecting to see some things that were slightly mentioned during the movie, I really thought they were gonna keep it mysterious even though it's Marvel.

I'm glad the comic relief characters weren't all there all the time, weren't the only ones being funny, and more importantly played a big role in the story. That was very pleasant.

Of course the acting was great too, and the sad scenes were believable. I rarely see a main character tearing up. I wish they could cry like a normal human would. A lot of movies suffer from the badass-blank-face protagonist, this wasn't totally the case here.

Big pro is the lack of forced romance, kissing and whatever. I hate that stuff. The girl always falls in love with the guy but not here (or it's not shown). Though the parents shouldn't have fallen in love either by my standards The only bit of blood in the movie was really fake looking, but the other 3D animated made up for it

One thing I'm not happy about is how confusing some action scenes are. No idea what's going on, or where the protagonist is going. It slows down for the important hits, but those are typical Marvel action scenes.

I also didn't like that the sister was overshadowed and that she forgave so easily.

Prismark10,6,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"Disney/Marvel has been applauded for its ethnic diversity in their superhero movies.

There is a danger that it could evolve into a cookie cutter approach. Take the easy way out and follow the Black Panther formula.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings does ride that wave.

Shaun/Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) is a slacker in San Francisco parking cars along with best friend Katy (Awkwafina.) Both live an easy lifestyle that involves hard partying. Their other friends have settled down and gone for career goals.

For Shaun everything changes when he is attacked one day on the bus. Katy discovers that Shaun has some whip smart martial arts moves.

Shaun believes that his father Wenwu a notorious gangster has sent the goons. His sister might also be in danger and flies off to find her.

Indeed Wenwu is an infamous and long lived immortal thanks to the Ten Rings. He changed his bad ways when he met and married a woman from a mystical land called Tal-Lo which is in another dimension.

Now Wenwu wants to be reunited with his children and go to Tal-Lo to free their mother who he believes is calling out to him. It might be a trap.

As in Black Widow, the Marvel Universe is building up to its next phase of superheroes and villains. You sense that there is more to come and again this feels low stakes.

Several characters pop in from previous Marvel movies. Liverpool FC is the soccer team of choice for Marvel.

There is some balletic martial arts sequences and some inspired Jackie Chan type moves.

However the shadow of Black Panther is not far away. The finale is too CGI heavy and it turns into a Godzilla monster on monster type bash with elements of Dune.",16 September 2021

kosmasp,9,Precious ... ten times,"Of course I am just riffing off, teasing and making fun of certain things with my summary line. Though there is some truth in there too - especially if you consider the last third of the movie - quite fantastical, pun intended.

But there is so much more here. And while you may have seen the bus scene already (I imagine many times), it still is quite the highlight and works wonders! Because there is even more to it than the trailer/teaser revealed! As is with the plot and the characters of the movie.

I was able to watch it on an Imax screen and let me tell you ... wow! But also wow and much respect to Marvel and Feige and anyone involved that they dared to make the first ten minutes or so in chinese! And throwing a lot of chinese terms (slang?) in there as well - throughout! That gives it a touch of authenticity. How immigrants in America or anywhere else in the world grew up. I do the same with my Greek and German/English.

It is also nice and while I am prone to be sarcastic, I really think it's a good thing to have such a major and big representation - especially nowadays with Anti-Asian hate/crime rising. All because of people blaming China and people of China for a virus ... the movie does not have that as a topic, it is entertainment after all, but in every promo and interview that the actors were involved it was something that was mentioned. Good for them and good for us, that this was made.

I am a bit biased when it comes to the MCU and this did get a pure theatrical release, instead of the Black Widow treatment (which also was available on Disney plus and the cinemas at the same time). So there is not issue when it comes to that. And if you can watch it on the big screen - you will not be dissapointed! Now waiting for the other stuff to drop ... especially after the mid credit scene, that is such a tease ... the after the credits scene might also hint at something, but the bigger tease was midway through the credits (actually almost at the beginning of them to be honest).

Sit back and enhoy the movie and the really funny characters ... and quite a few familiar faces. Some from the MCU and previous entries but also some from Asian cinema! Well done!",12 September 2021
kamsmith-71543,10,Wow,Everything about this movie is great I loved it so much the CGI towards the end was lacking but that's not a surprise that they would do that to this Asian led film they did it with black panther as well The fight scenes are fantastic I loved every one of them.

Harry_Gleeson,7,Another solid entry,"After the big disappointment of Black Widow, it's safe to say I was anticipating a better outing for Shang Chi and thankfully I lived up.

The action is the films biggest plus point. It's where the best scenes are on show, the choreography is brilliant alongside its kung fu/John Wick style fights.

The visuals are typical of a Marvel film, solid as always. The film however lost its emotional resonance through its writing. The heart of a film mainly comes from the screenplay and I felt the writing was slightly lazy in parts and that heart faded.

It's neither a perfect nor terrible film, it's a solid one that I enjoyed, even if it was hard to truly gravitate towards the characters.

andres_ge88,10,Absolutely loved it! Please Go watch it!,Shang Chi movie Review No spoilers Oh wow! I really loved this film! It really went above and beyond my expectations. To tell you the truth I had no idea of how it would play out. As a matter of fact I am pretty good at predicting this but this movie really had me guessing. I highly recommend to watch this film. Of course it's a Disney Film so it gave vibes similar to Mulan and of course it's an Oriental film so it gave vibes of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. And of course it's a Marvel Comics film but this isn't your regular Marvel movie. I highly recommend you to watch it if you haven't already. You are going to love it. Trust me. This is worth every penny.,6 September 2021

Although Simu Liu falters a little bit as a leading man, he has a truly impressive cast to support him. Awkwafina is brilliantly funny and quippy as she always is. And Tony Leung, the complex antagonist and the hero's father, has the most depth in this film.

The visual effects are beyond beautiful. They reminded me of Ferngully, and the nature I observed as a child. Good stuff!

MovieWarfare,8,The All Asian cast movie we have all been waiting for,"I once said after watching Black Panther, that it would be cool if there was an all Asian cast similar to it. There were some all Asian cast movies like Crazy Rich Asian (2018), but that is a romcom, and Mulan (2020), but that was bad. In comes Shang Chi which is the first Asian lead Superhero movie ever. The premise is ""Martial-arts master Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) confronts the past he thought he left behind when he's drawn into the web of the mysterious Ten Rings organization"". So does Shang Chi succeed in giving us a good all Asian cast big blockbuster or is it just another failed attempt?

Firstly, the action sequences and choreography are some of the best from Marvel since Captain America and the Winter Soldier (2014). Martial arts are the focus of the action scenes in Shang Chi and they are beautifully choreographed. We get the classic wire-fu/floating style of Crouching Tiger but we also get some Jackie Chan style with the utilization of the environment for the action. Each action scene is memorable and stunning to watch. Additionally, the action scenes avoid using lots of cuts and shaky cam which I was so grateful for. It is also clear that the actors themselves rehearsed the choreography making the fights feel more believable and gratifying. It does become a more typical MCU action sequence by the third act but even that is still pretty enjoyable even if it isn't as good as the first two acts.

The cinematography by Bill Pope (Matrix trilogy, Spiderman 2 and 3, Scott Pilgrim) is also excellent in Shang Chi. Skyscrapers and forests in Marvel movies have never looked as good as it has in Shang Chi. Bill pope and director Destin use the lighting and colours very effectively and allow for some genuinely beautiful shots. The music score by Joel P. West is also pretty good. Joel utilizes more electronic sounds and pop/rap songs for the scenes in the city but uses more traditional Asian instruments for the mystical areas. Joel's score captures the scene and the pop/rap songs themselves are also quite good albeit not as memorable as the Weeknd or Lamar from Black Panther. I also love the story and exploration of ""family"" with Shang Chi whilst not using Asian stereotypes. It also doesn't overuse humour like in Marvel's previous outing, Black Widow (2021), where they use jokes every couple of minutes and ruin a serious scene. Shang Chi thankfully avoids doing this, thus allowing the emotion of a scene to linger longer. There are still jokes though but they are genuinely quite funny.

Furthermore, Simu Liu is charismatic, charming and cool as the titular character Shang Chi. I think Marvel succeeds again in the casting department as Simu Liu delivers on making me believe that this guy is a top tier martial artist. I also think Simu gives a good performance during the more emotional moments as well. His chemistry with Awkwafina who plays Shang Chi's friend Katy is great too. The banter between Shang Chi and Katy is some of the funniest scenes and makes me believe that those two were friends for years. However, Tony Leung who plays the main villain Wenwu (the real Mandarin) is the one that steals the show. Tony Leung is just phenomenal as he can convey the exact emotions of his character just through body language alone, it is just masterful acting. My biggest worry with MCU origin movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Shang Chi does not fall into this. Wenwu is very sympathetic but also extremely fearsome. He is also the father of Shang Chi which makes the conflict between them feel more meaningful and tragic. Wenwu is not a straight-up evil person as he does still have good in him and I like that.

Unfortunately, Shang Chi suffers from having the 3 villain problem. Razorfist played by Florian is Wenwu's henchman and he doesn't get any backstory. I don't mind him that much though as he is mostly there to chase Shang Chi like a 007 henchman. There is also a scene where he does seem visibly worried about Wenwu's health which gives him some character depth. On the other hand, the 3rd villain Death Dealer who is a mysterious assassin of Wenwu is a massive disappointment. He looks very cool and visibly distinct from other ten ring members and is relevant to Shang Chi's past but amounts to absolutely nothing.

Moreover, there is also a 3rd hero to Shang Chi and Katy with Shang Chi's sister Xialing played by Meng'er Zhang. She doesn't get enough interactions with Shang Chi, Katy or her father Wenwu and that feels like a waste. It's a shame as her interactions with both Shang Chi and Katy are enjoyable and she also doesn't interact with her dad Wenwu which is just a missed opportunity for her character. The movie also has a pacing issue as it slows down significantly in the second act. It just featured a lot of talking, exposition and flashbacks which I felt could have been cut down by a couple of minutes.

Overall, Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the all Asian cast movie I have been waiting for. It delivers on the action, story and characters while being an exciting new addition to the MCU. I can't wait to see more of Shang Chi and finally get to see an Asian in the Avengers team.",4 September 2021

gabrielgarbagni,10,A Marvelous Ride,"At first glance, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is emotional, engaging and action packed. The truth is that there's so much more behind the surface. It is a story of self discovery, full of great character arcs, glorious fight scenes and dynamic choreography. Simu Liu really shines as the main character: he brings so much charm to the role that it's easy to grow fond of him. The director, Destin Daniel Cretton, manages to create a new mythology, both inspired by the comics and the Chinese tradition. The visual effects are great, even outstanding during certain moments, as well as the concept design of all the mythical creatures. Finally, the music really meshes amazingly with the scenes, especially when there's more action and emotion. A new modern superhero has arrived and he's ready to deliver some punches. This movie really pulls off a great origin story that proves, once again, the endless possibilities the Marvel Cinematic Universe has yet to offer.",4 September 2021

threenorns-1,8,"Lush, beautiful film that could have used a bit less dignity","Watched Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings - despite the movie title sounding like one of those 1940s black and white ""Detective Dee and the...."" types, the film is visually stunning: stunning scenery, magical creatures, gorgeous costumes, no-holds-barred fight scenes that are as much dancing as fighting, you name it.

I do have issues, however. The first is that I think Marvel was so worried about offending China or the Chinese people that the film comes across as very safe. Far too much on its dignity. If the film were a job interview, it would have been for the position of senior Vice President at the Chinese equivalent of the Louvre. Even Akwafina, who I usually count on to deliver a raunchy belly-laugh of a good time, was very composed and restrained.

I'm also wondering why they bothered including Shang-Chi's sister. She doesn't really *do* anything except be moody and resentful for the majority of the film. Even in the after-scene, she's not there. As far as I can tell, the entire point of her inclusion in the film is to get Shang-Chi to Macau (bonus points for it not being the overused Hong Kong or Singapore!).

Dignity or not, there was plenty of opportunity where they could have upped the humour quotient. The Chinese people are dignified - famous for it - but they also have a ribald and sophisticated sense of humour. I would have *loved* to see sly digs at Western culture, more commentary on differences between East and West (you can't tell me a guy spends his life in an isolated Chinese compound or in the States then just seamlessly segues to Macau's urban lifestyle!), that kind of thing - more than the stereotypical ""When are you getting married? When are you going to get a real job?"" conversation. Basically, they could have really *done* something with this movie, over and above a superhero story.

One thing I *really* want to see is a guide to the creatures we see in the film. They are so beautifully rendered! The Fu Dogs, for example - I was mesmerized watching the tiny little movements - ear flicks, muscle twitches as if reacting to a bug bite, the movement of the fur and mane: magnificent! But there were so many others I have no clue what they were other than they looked like Chinese mythological creatures and I would love to know more about them.",4 September 2021
AdrenalinDragon,8,Welcome back Marvel!,"After a disappointing Marvel entry with Black Widow, Shang-Chi is the return to form movie Marvel needed to bounce back off on. With solid performances, great setpieces, fun action sequences, and some emotional depth and humour to it, it's the type of film you need to see on the big screen and just go along with the journey and fantastical elements. It's also paced well and intriguing for the runtime it has.

The direction is solid and the characters get a good amount of screen time each to develop and have well placed flashback sequences. The martial arts fights are pretty well done and the CGI creatures look interesting with their designs and have good special effects. Overall, it's very well done and I didn't think Marvel could keep going, but they proved they can still make great stuff when they care about it.

-The jokes may not be funny to some people. But It's funny to me.

-The only issue I had with Shang-Chi was the third act. Not that it was bad, but it felt detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established. It become every MCU logic part(CGI BATTLE).

Let me... just say.. first of all.. OMG THE FIGHTS! THE ACTION! OH.. MY.. GOD. Marvel did it again after having a slight setback with the just okay black widow movie. This movie has the best fight scenes I've seen since the raid films. The fights are so well choreographed but also fast paced and filmed to perfection. The bus fight is incredible!!!!! The fight in the beginning between the mandarin and the mother.. wow wow wow... OKAY Back to reality. This movie does have flaws. First of all the pacing in like the 3/4rd of the film is a tat slow. The score honestly is weak. Might be my theater but there were moments where the score had to make me feel something and (credits to the movie itself that it let me ) i had to do that all by myself.

The plot sometimes leans to a pretty basic plot, but because of the great screenplay it works.

Cinematography was amazing. The acting was good. And the special effects were very good. One thing that I have to admit. Game of thrones kind of spoiled us with the design of .. a particular mythical creature so... that won't look as great as it could've been but still very good.

But man the fights were incredible.. the camera work was so good. Fluent movements but fast and I could see EVERYTHING. After snake eyes I thought I would never see a good martial arts movie again considering how average that was.

namob-43673,8,Finally something good again from Marvel,"Marvel has not done much good lately. 2 horrible TV shows, and 1 bad TV show. Not a single good movie since Captain Marvel, and nothing seemingly good coming over the horizon.

To be honest I have started to give up. Marvel have produced magnificent movies and great entertainment for many years, but lately it is like that magic has come off and they seem much more run of the mill basic with that, by now, boring Marvel feel. Marvel has tried to introduce more political correctness, more feminism, and more nonsense diversity, and it has all failed.

This movie however is not a failure.

Why?

This movie is simple, it is to the point, it follows tropes, cliches, and it is a classic heroes journey - which is exactly why it works!

Marvel took a classical story we all heard, read and seen before but they switched a few things around, kept some of that Marvel feel, and made it play out mainly in China and almost only with Chinese actors. And it works!

Imagine that? Sure you can find some political nonsense if you look hard enough, but who cares when you have great fight scenes, lovely sceneries, a great (but basic) story and brilliant well written characters.

We even get a villain that you understand, sympathise with and even feel a sting of ""ah, too bad"" about him.

This is how you make an action movie! Great stuff Marvel!

The points I deduct is due to the movie not being that amazing. They pull the heroes journey of sure, but we have also seen it done better. Sound is great, but not amazing, directing is great, but not amazing, etc. Etc. Everything about this movie is high class, greatly done, and well performed, but it is not on top, it is not amazing nor perfect.

I also have a few objections about the background story and the ending, but I am keeping this spoiler free so...

8/10. This is a great movie and highly entertaining, and definitely worth the ticket price. Go see and get your faith in Marvel restored.",3 September 2021

ohmymofngd,3,Where's the fast forward button?,"As I sat in the theater, my butt sore, I said to myself, ""How much longer? Can I fast forward?""

1. This film tries too hard to please Chinese authorities and make Marvel money in China. All bow down to the mighty dollar!

2. The pacing is GLACIAL. Shang-Chi is Mandarin for 60 minutes too long. My wife disagrees. She actually speaks Mandarin and says it means 30 minutes too long.

3. The lead character has all sorts of mental anguish over one person he killed, but in the film before this point, we have seen him kill several people.

4. Half this film makes no sense. For instance, the daughter of the bad guy escapes then starts an underground fight empire? Why? So there can be a cameo from another Marvel character and a big skyscraper fight scene that feels like it has zero consequences. And it does, because once the fight is over, they just give themselves up to the bad guy, their father. What?

5. Why the hell does nobody have any guns?

6. Isn't the Marvel universe a bit full of evil organizations that nobody has heard of? Hydra is gone. Now daddy and his rings are here.

7. They clipped Awkwafina's wings to make her palatable to the brainless Chinese market. She's a dirty, nasty comedian, and they make her an idiot.

8. White people are in the film only to play comic relief. There's Mr. Armsword, a buffoon. Then there's The Mandarin, an idiot. Why? Oh yeah, gotta please the Commie government.

Ben Kingsley is the ONLY bright spot in this turd film. He's genuinely funny as the Mandarin.",16 September 2021
adrien-pujol,6,Entertaining but that's it - why the hype?,"This is a beautiful movie, and it is entertaining. However the plot could not be more basic and the characters development more limited to what they could fit in between action scenes. All of this alongside some quite weird choices as to make Shaun's friend an essential character to the development of the story for future movies when she has no reason to be part of it at all, other than for being a liability... so all in all, I had a good time at the movie, but that's it. I reserve my good notes for movies that really deserve them.",12 September 2021
chupa-no-dedo,5,Marvel has nothing left to offer.,"Marvel has stopped trying and no longer wants to risk it. Why should they, when movies like this get all the praise.

In the beginning, Shaun was actually likeable, but as the movie progresses, he just kinda does stuff and his motivations are almost inexistent. The rest of the characters are bland and uninteresting.

The plot is all over the place and boring, filled with explanation after flashback after explanation, which makes it too long.

The fight scenes start off good, but then they just become huge and filled with cgi, and that just makes it boring for me.

In conclusion, this is a weekend movie to see with your family when it comes on tv, the kids will love it but the adults will forget it after 3 days. Just a generic tasteless movie.",11 September 2021
rohitreviews,6,Pointless story with few good moments to shine by overshadowed by cringe CGIs,"The story is like trying to say a lot but all over the place. It doesn't have any genuine nature to Eastern films, it clearly shows American crowd appeasing film made just to say to Asians, ""Look we did film for you by casting all Asians and few others and an amazing story"". It fails in many aspects be it from story, or acting or visuals, but they are always expert in marketing the mediocre or sometimes even worse film as good, great so on and make money.

This movie didn't have heart in right place at first instance. You don't even connect to Shang Chi's character neither anyone in the other roles. It's just feels so cookedup without genuine touch of Chinese or HK films. There is no strong theme or purpose of who is doing and what for. It all feels like we are doing this to make a character for Marvel.

The Marvels' usual formulaic movies are ripping off stories and many comics too, and it looks they only could touch upon few aspects of visuals in here but overall its an average or below average film. Since it's close to post pandemic times, so everyone are eager to watch, so it helped movie to shine through.

This PCness of Hollywood and American culture should shove their mindset in their A@#$ and let people do make their genuine films and accept the way it is rather then poking their nose in each films to give an mixed bag approach. They ruined Mulan doing this screwed up mindset of film making approach. I'm sure they will cover it up in Eternals, but still all these super hero movies now are so junk it seems.",11 September 2021

It's not a bunch of powerful people throwing out nonstop blasts or a strong thing throwing brute punching left and right.

The world is beautiful. The musical guides you. The tone filled with art and symbolism. Beautiful all around. And shoutout to Ronny Chieng! Seeing him make an appearance was pretty funny.

With some of the weaker elements I will have to point to the pacing. There were a few moments that felt dragged out or unnecessary. Some screen time was given to certain characters that didn't need it and they should focus a little more time on certain relationships.

akellashashank,7,An enjoyable ride throughout.,""" If you aim at nothing, you get nothing ""

Shang chi gets most of the part right with crazy action choreography which is undoubtedly the major attraction. First act is racy and has crazy action episodes and later, the recurring flashbacks served the story purpose but at the same time, slightly hindered the flow. Not a big issue though as the action part kicks in and makes up for it. Third act ten rings action visuals are pretty damn good and the water formation is breathtaking which reminded me of Raya.

New guy "" Simu Liu "" owned the Shang chi role, as his efforts are clearly visible on the screen. Especially during action episodes , he nailed it with his quick reflexes, even Meng'er Zhang as Chi's sister did put up an impressive act and Awkwafina provided a bit of humor with her quirky attitude . Fala Chen is so beautiful, i fell head over heels for her smile. The man, Tony Leung stood tall and delivered with panache, his presence worked big time. Always love to see Michelle Yeoh on the screen , she got that aura which pulls me in. Trevor and Morris stole the show, loved their bonding :)

Over all , with couple of surprises , good performances , amazing score , striking visuals and top notch action pieces makes this one an enjoyable ride throughout. Had a good time at the cinemas. Simu Liu is a fine addition to the MCU. Easily deserves solid 7-7.5 rating !!

rgkarim,9,"Not Quite a Ten, But Very Good Ring to Add To the Collection","Likes

Great Pacing: Shang Chi has a lot of things built into the tale as it tries to make an origin story fit so far into the movie series. With all the information, there might be worry of the pace being off, but surprisingly it is done super well. Never really dragging, but not moving a blinding pace (mostly), Shang Chi's combination tales keeps things moving but not flying over the important elements to connect with characters. The cast gets ample time to give us their backstories, piece together all the cluse of this dynamic drama puzzle, and not sacrifice on the action to come.

Character Development: The trailers may have you thinking this is a modern martial arts film, and in a sense they would be right. However, the movie takes it one step further and goes beyond the punches to instead give the characters some soul and layers compared to the legendary films of the past. Shang's life is complicated and torn between light and dark, his sister as well experiencing the drama in her own manner that parallels the main protagonist. Even the antagonist has layers far beyond what we normally get from the Marvel group, and I loved how well their lines mixed together to make this melodramatic family story fit naturally into the Marvel universe.

The Surprise Cameo: Can't say much without spoiling, but if you are like me, then you will not be disappointed who shows up in the film. Several questions are answered with this character's return and with it many laughs to be had in the manner very familiar to Marvel fans. The inclusion of this character also holds an important (albeit stretch) plot element to give a little more meaning behind it, and I loved the choices they made to include him in the big picture.

The Cultural Influence: Like Black Panther and the African Culture, Shang Chi integrates so much of the cultural values of the Asian provinces into this movie. The costumes are stunning takes on the traditional attire, bringing the past to light while also sewing in some modern styles to jazz up the outfits. Concepts of family honor, the customs to practicing Marshal Arts, and the honoring of family are well-integrated into the story and help give the predictable tale some extra Kung Fu kick. The architecture of most of the setting breathes new life to the typical cityscapes that have been made famous in Marvel, and the legends of the Ten rings scream of the Asian mythology that is seeped int heir history. I loved how well these things were merged into a Marvel tale, and though again a little predictable and flaunting, really elevated the origin story to stand out from so many others.

The CGI Finally Disney has invested in making their movies show off what the studio can do. Shan Chi and the bunch have plenty of amazing things to overuse the computer effects that the modern era loves. Special effects for the action scenes has more realism to it then Black Widow executed, the creatures you will see have a lot more polish and fluidity to their movements, and the special effects involving the ten rings are fluid and holding depth that I felt has been missing in some recent Marvel projects.

The Acting: A great part played by all members on this film, extras included, Shang Chi's cast shows that acting is not dead and characters can be utilized well. Simu Liu as the lead was fantastic, and his campaign for being in this movie could not have ended up with better results. He holds much of the prodigal martial artist, disciplined and focused to be an avid fighter capable of crushing his enemies with his style. However, he also has that troubled layer in the past to watch that helped spread his emotional spectrum. Awkwafina is still the same cooky role she always plays, but this time gets a little more balance and heroism compared to the other characters she has heralded as in the past. I loved how well she was used in this film, and how great she complemented Simu in this role. Leung brings a lot of pizazz to the character, once again giving us an antagonist with so much more than the scowl and fist, and I felt was a perfect casting to play the opponent of Shang Chi. So many other great actors and actresses in this film, but due to time restrictions I have to move on, but trust me they did well in their performances.

The Comedy: Awkwafina is often used too much for making us laugh, and Disney has struggled with forcing a lot of comedy to make it kid friendly. However, Shang Chi has taken some steps back into discipline and used the comedy well to break up the ice. Dialogue goes a long way to breaking in the laughs, with well-timed jokes and gags being the solid punch to the gut with comedy. There are several ridiculous inclusions in this film that at first seem out of place, but then roll back in to be an extravagant joke that had great set up. And the throw in references that come with it and you get a shining beacon of awesomeness that comes with this movie. It's all done so well and I was very happy with the results.

The Action: My bread and butter for most of the Marvel movies, Shang Chi delivered very well on this film's action expos√©. The art of choreographed battles brings another homage to Asian culture, and with it fantastic fights that had more bite and impressive skill use then half of the Marvel cinema. It's exciting, it's dynamic, and most of the fights have a different feel to them than what you might expect. Used well in the story, there is purpose behind the inclusion of the battles and each one has a different meaning and stakes behind it than simply punching and kicking. Even more so, the strategies behind them and what is required to win, accomplishes a level of storytelling that has been lost in the modern era, so well done on that too.

A Bit More Adult: The movie is definitely showing Marvel's modernization into the 21st century, and takes a risk of making this film darker and more adult than other installments. Cursing is definitely increased in this one, with plenty of swear words filling the dialogue, but not to the point of being overdone. No F bombs, but some of the language has got a little more bite, so caution. In addition, the tone of the tale is darker, and the sunshine and rainbows of Thor, Captain America, and Guardians is left in the dust for a grittier tale, which again is a plus.

Some of the political moments: While nowhere as bad as 75% of movies today, Shang Chi does sometimes get a bit preachy with the agenda politics of the film. Taking time out to rub it in our faces with an obvious line stating, ""Look what I had to do,"" was a bit of showboating that I could have done without. Yet even this dislike is marginal, given it's very little occurring, has some nice moments that build off of it, and sometimes has a fun lesson or joke built in.

A Little More Action:

The action in this movie is great, and I loved how much of it flowed and accomplished what I was expecting of the film, and things I was not expecting. Yet there were times where a moment of fighting felt a little forced, namely the chase scenes with vehicles that seemed like an afterthought. However, the fights at the end needed some more time for me, and perhaps a little more bouncing between the battles occurring at the same time. Star Wars has done this successfully in the past, showing all manners of battling and giving you a big scope of the battle. Shang Chi has done this better than several of the Marvel films, but still had some room to give us more looks at the other characters kicking butt. The battle is lengthy enough, I'll agree to that, but a little more showing off of the other warriors would have rounded this fight to perfection for me.

The VERDICT:

Shang Chi finally made me feel like we were back into the realm of Marvel I fell in love with years ago. A cultural building world with both origin and story continuation, this hero's quest had all the makings of a fun, exciting and swift adventure we were expecting. Buried beneath the amazing fights and special effects, was a deeper movie than I had expected, using their characters well and integrating them to serve a purpose. Balanced comedy with a cultural inclusion and politics did not steal away from the main theme of the movie, and giving it that adult touch was a plus in my book, though again caution with your little ones watching it. As for limitations, I agree there is predictability and familiarity with the movie, but the fresh twist and balance helps rejuvenate the formula and add minimize the impact of the limitations for me. Though I will say a little better wider scope battle is still needed by them. Overall, my scores for this film are:

Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0-9.5 Movie Overall: 8.5-9.0.",3 September 2021

guskeller,6,Comsumability over Creativity,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a prime example of consumability over creativity. Because of its formulaic nature, Shang-Chi will be indulged by many and revered by few. Everything about the script can be predicted and, by design, feels similar to its MCU predecessors. Technically, Shang-Chi seems crafted by a board room rather than specialized artists. The direction is indistinguishable, the production design is sterile, and the effects are ambitious but tonally incompatible. There are occasional visual delights but the cinematography is often executed for efficiency over artistry. None of this is necessarily upsetting but it gives Shang-Chi a bland undertone. Ultimately, this movie is competent and universally inoffensive but lacks genuine excitement or freshness.

On the positive side, the cast elevates the material. Awkwafina feels perfectly placed, Tony Leung Chiu-wai brings respectability, and Simu Liu is both likable and impressive in his choreography. Some fight scenes are fun, especially Simu Liu's first battle. That fight, in particular, is the most engaging part of the film and feels like a slightly new dynamic for the MCU. Unfortunately, that is all overshadowed by Disney's calculated monotony, leaving Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings to be another forgettable step in Disney's long line of safe bets.

sj7075-292-151006,3,"Boring, recycled, charmless, by order propaganda","Have you watched a Marvel action superhero movie before?

What if you've watched, ALL the Marvel superhero movies?

Then you're in for some HOT garbage in this movie, as this was made to order, copying EVERY scene from other Marvel movies.

I mean every fight scene just felt like I'd watched it before, except now the characters doing them I had even less connection with. I'm bored with fights on buses and trains and people leaping around scaffolding. Every Marvel movie has a fight scene on a bus or a train, but this one felt REALLY recycled.

Getting back round to the characters, besides Shang Chi, I can't remember his sisters name, or his weird friends name, who served zero purpose in the movie, accept serving as a loud mouthed joke teller. It was almost as if they wanted a Kevin Hart like star, but had to settle with Awkwafina? And Shang's sister? Just added nothing to the story or the movie. She looked NOTHING like Shang either, or her younger self, the casting was well off there.

Ben Kingsley showing up was amusing, but honestly that was it when it cames to laughs. You could see every joke coming up 30 seconds before it was delivered, because it was a recycled joke from other Marvel superhero movie.

Wong and The Abomination make a cameo appearance in this movie, but their addition is given NO CONTEXT, and makes zero sense, and adds nothing to the movie or their own stories.

Overall, I'd just say every character felt, just like a Chinese copy or a character you've already seen in a Marvel movie before. By the end, I felt like I had watched a propaganda movie made by the CCP. It was like ordering a Chinese, except it came drowned in a bath of Chinese sauce, served on a bed of soggy Chinese mythology.

jdgan,4,The best fight scenes but the worst comedy.,"The film has some of the most engaging fight scenes of any Marvel movie that came before, courtesy of the late Brad Allan (Kingsman). They feel so fluid, stylish and clear. It was perfect.

The Asian representation is also a welcome addition to the Marvel Universe. They've done it successfully before with African Culture in Black Panther and here, it's just as good. Who knows what this might bring to the Comic Book Genre in the future? Maybe we could get a proper Cassandra Cain and Lady Shiva adaptation?

Unfortunately, the comedy here is bad, though not as bad as Black Widow. There is one moment though, where the comedy ends up being the worst in the MCU. On a plane, Shang Chi recalls his past to Katy and we are treated to engaging flashbacks. The drama and emotion are there.......and then the stewardess interrupts them by asking if they want either vegetarian or beef, killing the mood completely. It's those moments that I hate the most in the entire MCU that kill off any potential drama, moments like Gamora kicking Starlord in Avengers Endgame, the destruction of Asgard being played for laughs in Thor Ragnarok, etc.

The pacing is kind of slow.

The character development is also a problem as we don't really see enough development of Shang-Chi himself, as he's sidelined in favor of Katy or Shang-Chi's sister. He does get some development but it's not enough.

On the positive side though, the acting is good, it's well cast, it's well shot, and we finally got an actual Mandarin but that's about it.",16 September 2021

bankofmarquis,8,See Shang-Chi on the Big Screen,"The new Marvel Super Hero film, SHANG-CHI and the LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is the kind of film that deserves to be seen on the big screen and Writer/Director Destin Daniel Cretton (JUST MERCY) has crafted a film that earns that statement.

Based on the Marvel comic book character (of course), SHANG-CHI tells the tale of...well...Shang-Chi a financially struggling - but happy - Valet in San Francisco who has a family secret.

Writer/Director Cretton has crafted a whimsical, mythological, mystical and action packed film that settles in at the top end of the Marvel Cinematic Universe family of films.

At the center, newcomer Simu Liu (KIM'S CONVENIENCE) more than holds his own as the newest Super Hero in the MCU. He is grounded, centered and more sure than unsure as he discovers his abilities and his family's secrets. He is a worthy addition to this world of Superheroes.

Joining him is the remarkable Awkwafina (CRAZY, RICH ASIANS) as his best friend, sidekick who handles the drama comedy and action with aplomb. This film makes some smart choices with this character and Awkwafina shines.

The rest of the cast/characters are equally as strong from Tony Chi-Wai Leung (as Shang-Chi's father) to Meng'er Zhang (as Shang-Chi's sister) and good ol' Michelle Yeoh (as Shang-Chi's Aunt) bring strong characters to life. They all shine.

This film also brings back a character from a previous MCU film that somewhat redeems the poorly conceived character from his earlier appearance. I won't spoil it by saying who it is, but I liked what the MCU did with this character.

But, this being a Marvel movie, all of these performances anchor a bigger picture that is filled with action, action and more action - and something else, something mystical.

Here is where Director Cretton really shines. The action scenes are interestingly staged and choreographed well. The first fight (the bus fight that is shown in the trailer) and a fight on scaffolding both particularly work well.

This film does delve into the mystical in the last 1/3 and in Cretton's hands, this ends up working well instead of being comical or inane. I bought what was going on and was rooting for our heroes to defeat the undefeatable, fantastical creatures.

To be honest, the ""final battle"" didn't really live up to the rest of the film so that brings this film down a notch, but this movie did what it needed it to do, it opened up a whole new area of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - in both character and locations - and I am anxious to see where they go from here.

Try to see SHANG-CHI on the Big Screen, the visuals are worth it.

afwhitepigeon,10,In a word: Stunning.,"Shang-Chi will likely be heralded as the ""Chinese Black Panther,"" but in truth, this is the film Black Panther wants to be when it grows up. Easily top-5 in the MCU, and probably competes with Guardians of the Galaxy for my favorite of the bunch.

There are several nods to the wider universe, and if you're a die-hard fan, they'll be quite rewarding, but they never distract from this mostly self-contained story.

This movie is at times seriously, laugh-out-loud funny, but it never falls into the trap of allowing humor to undermine its emotional moments. Ben Kingsley and Awkwafina give particularly standout performances. And if the latter's, shall we say, overt comedic style can get grating for you, know that not only does she deliver it in small doses, but she also has some surprisingly heartfelt moments, too.

Perhaps the most spectacular feature of this movie is its stuntwork. There are multiple incredibly long, exceedingly well-choreogrphed fight scenes. There are some which are the most creative, crazy, acrobatic fights since Jackie Chan's glory days in Hong Kong Cinema. Others take clear inspiration from the dance-like wirework of Wuxia films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, even borrowing one of its lead actors for one of them. Throughout, the camerawork is clear, without the rapid-fire cutting that pervades much of Hollywood. The cinematography at times takes wide angles to really showcase, rather than mask, its stunt performers. At other times, the cameraman is treated as another performer, right in the heart of the acrobatic choreography.

While the the practical stunts will get lots of attention, the visual effects are just as beautiful, taking full advantage of the blockbuster budget. There are elemental effects that prove that a live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender movie could work. There are creatures that range from cute, cuddly animals to monsters that would make Kaiju films jealous. This movie even pulls off the difficult trick of making energy-based sci-fi weapons seem raw and visceral.

In the center of all this spectacle is a surprisingly resonant personal story about a broken family. Tony Leung gives an incredible performance, making a millenia-old, super-powered warlord not just sympathetic, but even relatable. The titular character embodies one of the film's central themes of bringing together aspects of disparate influences to forge a unique identity. The other lead has a similar story, but hers is arguably even more compelling.

All in all, Shang-Chi is a film that does just about everything right, and it does so while bringing its own fresh take, not just to the MCU, but to Hollywood filmmaking in general. They really knocked it out of the park with this one.",8 September 2021

Story wise, Shang Chi was good, not great, but solid. Displays Asian values perfectly. I found a few of the Chinese lines irritating to hear, as a native Mandarin speaker.

The martial arts sequences were simply amazing. Fights scenes were captivating and beautiful, with superb special affects on top of the actual martial arts. With the Eternals coming up, Marvel is clearly upping its CGI and special affects making much more cinematographic films.

My only complaint was the ending, went from one of Marvel's best into Godzilla. I don't think you'll find anyone praising it. A weak ending for an overall amazing film.",7 September 2021

Great movie.

TINY TINY SPOILER ABOUT POST CREDIT SCENES But I did leave with a bad taste in my mouth because the critics said the post credit scenes were endgame level hype and I was so excited, expected Tobey and/or Andrew, or some x-men, spoiler alert, not even close, wasn't that good.

It may be at it's core the same: hero goes to a journey to learn and defeat the bad guy but it doesn't stop there and pushes it further. Antagonists have their legit reason to be bad and not just for the sake of ""I'm bad because yes"".

jaredkjacoby,7,Want Amazing Action and Visuals? It's Here!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Seven Rings tells the story of a young man named Xu Shang-Chi who has to confront his past after confronting an organization run by his dad, Xu Wenwu. After obtaining the Ten Rings, Wenwu is given immortality and the power to overthrow governments through different times, but he falls in love with a woman from the village in a magical forest. After Shang-Chi's mom's death, Wenwu wants to find a way to revive her in the village, but Shang-Chi and his sister need to stop him and his army from causing further destruction.

As soon as I saw the trailer, I knew that Shang-Chi was a film I had to see. Everything in the film was right up my alley. Martial Arts, dragons, other strange creatures, cool visuals and magic. The fact that this was a Marvel film did not really cross my mind. This looked like the perfect kind of movie see on the big screen. How does it stack up to the other Marvel films?

The story to Shang-Chi is pretty typical when it comes to adventure films like this. What makes it work is that it focuses on building the characters throughout the film and giving the right balance of action and development for the film. It also helps that there is less humor here than in most Marvel films. It takes itself much more seriously as the origin story of Shang-Chi. That being said, the comedic moments here are really funny. They are perfectly timed for the most part and they are clever. The pacing is pretty solid too. It is not too fast nor too slow. The world-building is more vast than I thought it would be. There are creatures, powers, weapons and magic everywhere here as well as a magical forest. It all fits in nicely to the story. My only complaint about the story is that Xialing could have used more development or screen time. She has less to do than the other main characters and I really wanted to know more about her and how she built the underground fighting ring. Overall, the story is good.

The performances are great and they elevate the characters. You can tell how excited Simu Liu was for this movie. He shows his passion in every scene he is in. Not only does he do great with the dialogue and the reactions, but he is a great fighter too. He was perfect for the role and he came off as a very natural protagonist who just wants to reunite with his family, but do the right thing. Shang-Chi is also a good character because he learned to be a good fighter without the rings, but not to the point where he was invincible. The movie also has Awkwafina as Katy who is a fun addition that adds some lighthearted scenes for a rather dark film while still being part of the action and getting serious when she needs to. Meng'er Zhang as Xialing is quite good as well. She comes of as incredibly powerful as she commands every scene she is in. Her backstory is pretty tragic with how her father treated her. I really want to see more from her in future MCU projects because her running an underground fight club is one of the most interesting parts about this movie.

Then there is Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father, also the villain. While I still think Kilmonger and Vulture are the best MCU villains, Xu Wenwu makes for a great villain. He is one of those villains who definitely needs to be stopped and you root for the protagonists over, but you can also stop and sympathize with him. He legitimately loved his family and he started to become destructive after a tragedy in the family. It also helps that he thinks he is bringing the family together when he is actually tearing it apart further, adding an extra element of sympathy or tragedy to his character. Leung's performance makes Wenwu's character so human that I was actually rooting for him to turn good by the end of the film. He makes him not just the leader of the Ten Rings, but as a normal father raising his kids with his wife. These moments show why it is important to give villains depth in their motivations and backgrounds and it is why Wenwu makes for one of the better MCU villains.

The visuals in this movie are insane. This is easily the best looking Marvel film by a long shot. It has some stunning and inventive cinematography as well as some great special effects. What really got me excited were the awesome action scenes in the film. There are plenty of martial arts fights here and they have great stunt work and camerawork making them so fun to watch. The power of the Seven Rings looks really cool and made the fights even more fun to watch. And then the climax came and gave me what I wanted... I will not say much, but it is one of the most exciting fights in the MCU. This movie also has an incredibly memorable and catchy musical theme. It is easily the best score in a Marvel film.

Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Seven Rings is really good. I think even people who do not like Marvel would get into this film. Not only does it have the best visuals and action of a Marvel film, but it also has a really good story with some likable and relatable characters.

As usual with a Marvel film, stay through the credits.",6 September 2021

Secondly, the story is explained with great care and it introduces the audience with amazing, new and fleshed out characters that really elevate this film to another level.

Furthermore, the cast is exceptional and I couldn't have imagined any other cast to represent these characters. This reminded me of how the original Avengers were perfectly cast for their roles. That said, I really have absolutely nothing bad to say about the cast. They played some distinct characters compared to the rest of the MCU with their set of quirks, stories, backgrounds and lives in general.

The only small complaint that I had while watching this movie was that the movie had spent a good portion of its runtime dwelling in the past about certain characters.

thevision-44664,8,Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings,"After a long time, everyone, especially the Marvel Studios' fans has a chance to watch their latest movie in theatres. And to be honest they will be pleased and they SHOULD watch this in theatres. You will get everything you need from a Marvel flick.

Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings gives a new look at a new hero. It's fresh and it's entertainment at best. To start with positive aspects, the performance as usual are Good. Marvel never misses their castings. Everyone gave their best. Especially the leads Liu and Lueng. Both portrayed themselves perfectly. I was expecting Awkwafina to be a cringe, but she didn't disappointed. Action just brilliant, flawless. The screenplay is elegant. Seeing what new Marvel is showing and what more is about to come will crave fans and everyone for more. Especially the concept of Ten Rings. The mysticism and spiritual material is displayed brilliantly. Fantasy at it's peak. The CGI is just.. flawless as usual. Works tooo damn neat.

The bad aspects of the movie I consider is the Wenvu's (Leung) unsatisfactory agenda. He's clearly a brilliant intimidating villian but with his agenda, he seems nothing but a Delusional guy. The Wong and Abomination arc shown in the trailers fails to deliver any justice. The guy, so they say ""Death Dealer"" was supposed to be a prominent badass, but they wasted his potential. And Marvel can't keep re-using the formula of ""Big Third Act"", ""Good vs. Evil"", with loads of CGI, they have to use and start giving new screenplays for climax. (also the last thing with Katy being sudden Hawkeye in the climax is just.. facepalm. No way they did that!)

Nevertheless, the movie works fine. Along with superb cinematography, good direction and decent background score. Go watch this movie, you'll enjoy and have a good time. Must watch. Not a definite Marvel Masterpiece, but works and balances well with Humor and Outstanding Action.

Shang Chi And The Legend Of Ten Rings: 4/5 Stars.",5 September 2021
yusuftyer,9,Fantastically Cultured,"The movie starts with a beautifully narrated and visually stunning story. This is always important to engage the audience from the first moment. This becomes a norm throughout the film.

Marvel films are well known for their pop culture references but this movie does not fall into the trap of putting in references just for the sake of it. There is a perfect balance of comedic relief and heartfelt moments.

The characters are well constructed, especially Shang-Chi, Xialing and the Mandarin. However, I felt that Katy lacked depth.

The movie ended strongly with conflicting feelings about the antagonist. The movie leaves you thinking about it days after it ends.

Benslie,9,Overcomes stereotypical Marvel movie elements to feel refreshing,"One of the real standouts for me in the movie was the fights scenes. The MCU is not really known for having interesting fight scenes and really most of them are just bland and clich√© but Shang-Chi brought something new and I loved it. Every single fight scene was so well done and paced super well and Destin Daniel Cretton, who directed this, did an amazing job directing the fight scenes in this movie. The fight scenes in this movie were probably the best part especially since you can tell that all of the actors in this movie, especially Simu Liu, did most of the stunt work themselves. It's also insane to think that other than this movie Simu Liu has only really acted in one other thing but you could barely tell. He played Shang-Chi so well and brought so much emotion that everybody can easily relate to and love him. Honestly, everybody did an amazing job acting in this movie and I have to say I was skeptical with Awkwafina, who plays Katy, but she proved me wrong. But for me, the real scene-stealer was Tony Chiu-Wai Leung, who plays Xu Wenwu, as the villain. The villains in Marvel movies are mediocre at best but he decided to change that with this movie. Xu Wenwu was such an intriguing villain that the audience can easily sympathize with and relate to him. The cinematography in this movie is gorgeous to look at and you can see the detail that was put into it. Depending on where the movie is at the lighting reflects that area. I will say though is that this movie has a bit of slower pacing that at times does work in its favour but in other parts, I very much was wanting the movie to hurry up. In the end, Shang-Chi is such a heartfelt Marvel movie that does have some issues but is still enjoyable.",5 September 2021

marauder-02891,8,The movie has story telling and action in a working balance.,"The people who give the movie a 1-4/10 reviews are having an agenda against this movie, and they are not honest or objective about it at all.

The comic version of the mandarin is different, the power of the ten rings are different, does it make he movie bad? Not at all.

The ""Marvel formula"" is present here, but it shows a different part of the MCU and it is just like the Black Panther, an important part of world building.

The theme of the movie is about family, i expected it focused more on the action, but it had a unique balance between the story telling and the action scenes, you get them both at the same time and it makes sense.

I write this review only because it is a very petty thing to downplay or misrepresent a movie just because of an agenda, and i see that a lot nowdays.

The actors were good, the mandarin, Tony Leung Chiu-Wai was the main reason i watched this movie and he did not disappointed me.

awesome1976,10,Marvel Phase 4 is off to a flyer!,"PHENOMENAL! Absolutely phenomenal! I was worried going into this movie wondering how Shang Chi was going to fit into the MCU. By the 23rd minute... I had a fair idea. By the finale, it was crystal clear. The doors of what is possible in the MCU has been truly kicked off it's hinges!

Guaranteed come Monday morning, kids around the world will be busting their parents chops to get into a Martial Art class. Marvels newest addition to the live action roster will have the same impact as Bruce Lee and Jackie Chan had on many here growing up. It's a certainty.

Action scenes are aplenty and jaw dropping. I have seen way too many Martial Art movies but this for sheer creativity is up there with the best. Score is beautifully written. Story although predictable, does what it needs to do without grinding the movie to a halt. Acting is top notch especially with the lead Simu Liu and Tony Leung Chui-wai.

Mind few (back and forth) narrative problems, Destin Daniel Cretton successfully put humor and heart in right time and places.

Thanks to scintillating cast who lit up the screen especially charismatic Tony Leung.

Chemistry between Simu & Awkwafina as besties are undeniably good.

justinwfirestone,4,A cookie-cutter snoozefest,"Crouch, you tiger! Hide, you dragon! Wax on and wax off, and fight, fight, fight!

The title is as annoyingly long as the movie itself, which itself is an exercise in some ho-hum and perfunctory dotting of Is and crossing of Ts. As we wade into the shallow waters of whatever the next batch of uninspired Marvel movies present to our collective global faces, it becomes increasingly difficult to feel that old sense of joy and inspiration moviegoers used to call Movie Magic, maybe because everything is oh-so-magical all the time, a crisp and bloated 132 minutes worth.

It seems almost impossible to reveal any spoilers for a movie such as this, where the plot could fit on a business card printed in a large font, something like: ""Hero shows off, struggles midway, then overcomes substantial adversity to win once again."" Will there be any sequels? Will Shang-Chi become part of the greater Marvel Cashcowiverse? Will Disney buy up other intellectual properties and make more of the same type thing?

It should not feel like work when one goes to a show, and it is completely acceptable to check one's brain at the door, but these movies are becoming absolutely tedious, ponderous, even. Ponderous.",17 September 2021

The movie had a lot of comedy, action And story line was a little played out but still amazing.

alindsay-al,8,A Great New Film in the MCU,"The next instalment of the MCU, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has come out and I managed to see it the other day and I have finally found time to review it and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a young martial artist forced to face his past when his criminal father comes hunting for him.

Main Character Relative unknown Simu Liu plays Shang-Chi and he is really good in this role. He really delivers a strong performance and you will come out of the film really liking him and caring about the character of Shang-Chi. The focus on his family dynamic is really well done and Liu does a great job in selling that and showing the pain that he has been through in his life and bringing this great hero to life. He is also fantastic in the action scenes and that is a huge part of this film and you have to believe in the heroes capabilities and I really did.

Supporting Characters Awkwafina plays his best friend Katy and I feel like this character is really going to split opinion, some will hate her, some will love her. I pretty much hit both ends of the spectrum, I thought she was really annoying in the first act of the film and it hurt my enjoyment, but as she had her role slightly lessened she became much more likeable and her character arc became very clear. Tony Leung plays his first role in an American film playing Wenwu and this is one of the best antagonists in the current MCU. I loved this character and performance, he isn't just some generic bad guy and at times I really understood his motivations and saw the emotion from his performance and it was really strong. Meng'er Zhang plays Xialing and I liked her character here and I thought it really complemented Shang-Chi really well. There is clearly issues there and the film plays it up well, and makes her more then just this female sidekick and she is given a personality.

Story The story is at its strongest when it focuses on the family issues between the characters, in particular Shang-Chi and Wenwu. That father and son dynamic is great and both actors deliver really well in their roles and it makes there clashes feel even more important as you genuinely care about both of them in the film. The issue is that the film kind of strays away from that and tries to focus on too much. It has plenty of exposition scenes and fits so much in that it distracts from the main thing that makes this film great. The final act puts the focus in the wrong place, its hard to explain without spoilers but I think you will know what I mean if you watch the film.

Script The script is okay, the drama is really well done and made me care about these characters and the emotional predicaments that they are put in during this adventure and I actually think this film is held back a little bit by the fact that it is in the MCU. What I mean by that is that it has the humour you come to expect from the universe is here but it is done poorly and I never really laughed at all and that was a disappointment.

Style The film looks fantastic, the CGI is all beautiful and I think it does an excellent job of building this world of Martial arts that is very different to other elements of the MCU. The fight scenes live up to the hype and are the best that have been seen in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, the flow so well and are so hard hitting that it is easily the best element of the film.

Overall Overall, Shang-Chi and The Legend of The Ten Rings is a great film and another solid addition to The Marvel Cinematic Universe. It isn't top tier Marvel but does a great job of introducing a new hero in Shang-Chi.",9 September 2021

The good: The most remarkable factor was the coreography from the action/fight sequences, very fluid and not exagerated.

The soundtrack was another amazing factor, we are talking of a mixture of cultures (i really felt Black Panther vibes on this one) that can engage all the marvel and non marvel fans out there.

Regards of the plot, this one was very emotional and with lot of heart and power.

The cgi effects was on point (which was my biggest fear and sometimes a let down on other mcu films)

The bad: Shang chi, along side of the cast lacks of good and reliable acting which with combining with the signature forced jokes was little annoying to see.

Althought the plot was simple, this was a little predictable, but overall enjoyable.

qdliusiwen,7,Leung's acting overshadowed everything,null,20 September 2021
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,8,Indeed legendary,"It's been ten years since Shang-Chi(Liu, charming, stoic) last saw his father, and leader of the criminal empire The Ten Rings, Wenwu(Leung, charismatic enough that we feel a lot of empathy for him, even when he does terrible things that we desperately want him to stop doing). That was also when he last spent time with his sister, Xialing(Zhang, a badass who deserves more screen time. Honestly, I'd be very surprised if she didn't, in future projects). He's joined by his friend Katy(Awkwafina, quirky, providing a lot of comic relief, something I'm told she's in general adept at), for what can best be described as a tense reunion, which allows the movie to really mine the family melodrama, one of the best elements it has. I won't give away exactly what the antagonist intends to do, only that our hero has to stop him. However, he has to figure out how, maybe even if, that is even possible.

Not quite, yet almost ""Black Panther for Asian audiences"", this does a lot for representation(including for women. Some of the best characters in this are female. In addition to the two that I've already mentioned, there is also Ying Nan(Yeoh, wise)), it is positively drenched in Chinese culture(the third act, while in ways it feels like it belongs to a completely different film than the first two, takes an especially deep dive into that. Ultimately, it is presented through a Western lens, and clearly we need to go further in this direction, still, it is a big deal that they put so much of it in an estimated $150 to 200 million major blockbuster, which will be seen by millions of people who would never consider watching an art picture, especially one focusing on a group they don't belong to), to the point where countless times, when it makes sense, major characters in this speak Mandarin to each other, rather than English, which it is subtitled into. And ""don't worry"", for those who think that the following is important: there are white people on screen, and they aren't made out to be ""less than"".

The action(each sequence of which feels distinct, belongs with the rest, and is memorable) pays tribute to many different kinds of martial arts films, acknowledging that they are standing on the shoulders of giants. Jackie Chan, wuxia, etc. The choreography is matched in skill by the cinematography. Not only are we seeing incredible fighting, the camera is dynamic, celebrating and highlighting how incredible it is. That *is* why you hire Bill Pope, the director of photography on the Matrix trilogy, two of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man entries, Darkman and Team America. The special effects are excellent. There are some issues with pacing, and certainly a chunk of this is composed almost entirely of flashbacks.

This features relatively brief but highly concentrated, surprisingly graphic gore(you know, there was a time when the fact that it's happening to beings that clearly are not human, wasn't enough to get away with this kind of thing with a PG-13 rating. Pepperidge Farm remembers), as well as a little strong language. I recommend this to any fan of comic book movie adaptations, and people passionate about diversity hiring. 8/10.",10 September 2021

-You've already heard people praising the film's action choreography, and it's well-deserved. It doesn't has many cut scenes like many MCU fighting scenes.

-This film felt completely unique from what we've seen from the MCU already.

-Props to the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack as well, they were great!

-The first two act was incredible and amazing showing the life of Shang-Chi, how Wenwu meet his wife etc. This type of act is something MCU usually doesn't have.

-This film open up MCU to new world with myth creature, many evil organization, and the mystery of the Ten Rings.

NEGATIVE -The casting was STELLAR. Aside from the one person I didn't care for (*Razor Fist, cough cough*) everybody played their roles to perfection.

-The jokes may not be funny to some people. But It's funny to me.

-The only issue I had with Shang-Chi was the third act. Not that it was bad, but it felt detracting from what the first 2/3rds of the movie established. It become every MCU logic part(CGI BATTLE). It took away from the great hand-to-hand action stunt work, but it's to be expected from a film of this genre.

moviematthewh-60783,8,"Standard repetitive storyline, but the concepts are creative and fresh","Right from the start I realised that the plot structure and storyline was very standard and repetitive. It's seen in many other action/superhero films. But as the action kicked in, I was still invested. It's a very fast paced movie with some new action sequences we haven't seen in the mcu yet, as well as some good comedic moments. The choreography for the action is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Very long cuts show all the action without quick cuts after every move someone takes. It's also a very beautiful film I thought in terms of scenery and colours. Music was also great, epic score and some killer songs. Definitely check out the soundtrack. But as the film entered its long third act, the ending was very underwhelming. We are being thrown at with so much stuff in a short period of time, so the reveals of some things and actions aren't as interesting as they should of been. But the film has opened up even more possibilities for what's to come in the mcu timeline, so make sure to stay for those credits scenes. But even someone who hasn't seen any or a few mcu films can watch this as it's a good standalone film. They may not understand a few things that characters talk about regarding previous events but I could assume that they'd still be invested. Overall, a solid entry for our new character Shang-Chi in the mcu, as well as having some awesome action, funny moments and eye popping miss en scene.",17 September 2021
kluseba,7,Marvel movie by the numbers with beautiful dragons and charming locations,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is yet another movie inspired by the Marvel universe that has constantly been inspiring the cinematic world for more than a decade now. While the movie follows the usual stereotypes, it manages to stand out with its stunning special effects and locations.

The movie revolves around Shaun, a Chinese immigrant living in the United States of America who is working as a valet with his quirky friend and soulmate Katy. One day, they get attacked by a group of assassins on a bus and only just manage to survive. Shaun immediately understands that the attack must be related to his influential estranged father. Along with Katy, he decides to team up with his tough estranged sister Xialing to find out what's going on.

This film convinces on multiple levels. First of all, the acting performances are quite quirky and convincing. Especially the ladies steal the show. Awkwafina delivers the goods as curious, dynamic and funny woman that anyone would like to have as a friend. Zhang Meng'er on the other side represents a much darker character shaped by dramatic events from the past who is much more difficult to approach with her tough, relentless and independent personality.

The expensive special effects certainly deliver the goods as well. The scenes in a fantasy world, in Ancient China and in contemporary San Francisco are all equally stunning to watch. The fantastic creatures such as dragons look impressive on the big screen.

The story might be predictable but is nevertheless entertaining from start to finish thanks to steady pace and inspired execution. You will truly care about the fates of the different characters as you are watching this film.

However, this film isn't without its occasional flaws. First of all, lead actor Simu Liu simply doesn't have the charisma of the other actresses and actors involved. Casting him was a bold choice but it didn't fully pay off in my opinion.

Up next, the movie desperately tries to connect to other characters in the Marvel Universe. The appearance of Trevor Slattery played by Ben Kingsley is completely random as it only seems to be a pretext to offer some misplaced comic relief. The mid-credit scene starts in an amusing fashion but suddenly involving Bruce Banner and Carol Danvers only seems like a weak attempt to develop a hype for potential sequels. The same goes for yet another scene after the credits that evokes more questions rather than concluding the film appropriately.

At the end of the day, Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is an entertaining fantasy action film of the Marvel Universe that should appeal to faithful and occasional fans alike. It's one of the better films in the franchise but perhaps Marvel should focus on quality over quantity instead of becoming a monstrous capitalistic machine that is scarier than any gigantic dragon shown in the film.",17 September 2021
kaden_lewis,10,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"This movie was great, it was entertaining, it was fast paced, and it was unique. There were so many things I liked about this film. First off, I loved all the characters, such as Shang-Chi, Katy, Xu Wenwu, Xialing, Razor Fist, Death Dealer, the return of Trevor Slattery, Morris, and of course Master Guang Bo. The actors for all these characters were also perfect. They suited their roles perfectly. In my opinion, this movie had some of the best supporting characters in the MCU. I also loved the action. It was absolutely amazing, there were some points in the movie where I felt like I was watching a martial arts movie. The stunts and the choreography were perfect, I couldn't have asked for anything more. The effects in this movie were also stunning. The moving forest, the mythical creatures (especially the dragon), and the effects used on the Ten Rings were super cool. The effects in this movie were some of the best in the MCU. Lastly, I also loved the plot, it just sat really well with me.

This movie was like nothing we have ever seen before in the MCU. It was very unique and a nice twist for Marvel.

cardsrock,8,Showcases the possibilities of Phase 4,"This was the right direction for Marvel to head post-Endgame. Finding new stories to tell within cultures rarely explored is the way for the MCU to continue to entertain.

The fights in the first third of this movie were absolutely brutal and quite innovative. I wish they hadn't front-loaded all of this stunning choreography since the fights later on paled in comparison. This film also contains arguably the most beautiful and artful scene in the MCU with the Crouching Tiger-inspired hidden garden duel. There was a sense of more indie-based filmmaking and I really enjoyed that fresh take on the genre. I would be remiss not to mention Tony Leung, who perfectly brings to life one of the finest villains in the MCU. His character has a lot of depth and is one you can truly empathize with.

While there are still the tropes expected in a Marvel origin film, it succeeds pretty well for the most part. I wish the big CGI battle at the end had just been a personal fight between father and son, but alas. The humor, especially Awkwafina, was pretty hit or miss as well. The Trevor Slattery stuff was great though.

The fight seems are incredible - the bus fight being the stand out. Fantastic choreography and heavily influenced by old martial arts movies. The CGI throughout is amazing too as you'd expect from Marvel. I felt the amount of comedy was just right with Ben Kingsley smashing it again as Trevor - superb. As others have commented there are some pacing issues in the second half but overall it's a fun ride so enjoy! The first end credits scene is worth holding on for but don't bother with the second!,9 September 2021

""Shang Chi"" feels like no other MCU production because of this interplay of seemingly dissimilar elements. But, where else could one possibly come across such an engrossing mix than in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where a raccoon once sent e-mails to a Russian assassin? That's the beauty of ""Shang Chi;"" it propels quite enthusiastically and energetically into this vast inexplicable new terrain which only Stan Lee and his fellow artists and creators could have envisioned or foretold.

owenlong-52387,8,Tony Leung upgrades it to another level! Actions are good.,"I am not interested in popcorn movies at all. However, when I knew that Tony Leung is one of the main cast. I gave my last chance to Marvel.

The fight scenes mix with styles from Ip Man, Kung-Fu...., this movie reached 80% of the standard. Especially for the fight between Wen-Wu and his wife.(Which is shown in the trailer)

Also the plot is better than normal MCU movies. At least there is a all-round character description for Shang-Chi and other role players. Fair performance from every actor. However, Tony Leung(Wen-Hu) shown why he is the best actor of Cannes. Every move, eye-contact, voice is well-designed. He creates WenWu himself. (It has to give credit to the director also) He shown the reason why WenWu did those bad things.

After all, Shang-Chi is a superhero movie. Description would not be detailed as the movie which Tony Leung casted normally. However, as one of the Tony's fan. It is a breakthrough for him. He seemed enjoyed from the interviews. Hope can see the background of WenWu in another movie.",6 September 2021

Monarch_1,7,A Perfect Marvel Solo origin movie,"The journey of a self doubting and traumatized person into confident saviour of the world. Now add in some loyal characters who always believe in the protagonist's ability and some humour, now you have Marvel's good old formula for Solo origin movies.

Marvel has perfected this formula and it works. It is fun to watch Simu Liu's Shang-Chi growing into the worthy hero to possess legendary ten rings. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's Wen wu easily dominates the screen presence and leaves lasting impression on the viewers. Ageless Michelle yeoh does her part very well and Awkwafina is....there.

Besides the Captain America and the winter soldier, this movie has some of the best hand to hand combat scenes in the whole MCU. The Mid credits scene was a surprise and Marvel fans, Don't miss it.

While the movie is not boring, it doesn't take risks and doesn't venture into unique and bold story telling like GOTG, Infinity war and Endgame. If you have watched both trailers for this movie, you pretty much know what's gonna happen after spending 15 mins into the movie.

Overall, Shang-Chi is a worthy addition to the MCU (Or should I say MCM üòâ? ) and a decent movie to visit theatres after two long years.",6 September 2021

If you're looking for a martial arts movie, it's not Enter the Dragon and it's certainly not superhero like Spider-man or Superman. It's different, fresh, and I can see why many will love it. You could hate superheroes in general and still love this movie, so it would be a shame for people to avoid this movie because they don't like Superhero movies.

nycweboy1,7,Fine addition to a genre that's wearing thin,"The ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Wakanda"" layering on of endless flashbacks and ""ancient legends"" gets a bit thick (and sags noticeably in the back half), but overall this addition of an Asian superhero story hits all the right notes, powered mainly by 2 early bravura action sequences (scaffolding on the side of a high rise mirror glass tower is especially well rendered). The performances are solid, if not exactly groundbreaking (Michelle Teoh especially has little new to do), and the direction is serviceable. But the whole thing ends in yet another CGI heavy big bass fight that is just... well, way too predictable. Snazzy post credit sequence teases Dr Strange but also adds more mystery to the 10 Rimgs... which is becoming Marvel's staple out: always teasing better content next time.

nancyldraper,10,Perfect,"Honestly, on all levels this movie excels! The casting is perfect. The world building is creative, beautiful and faithful to its Asian roots. The CGI and location shoots are breathtaking. The fighting is the best I've ever seen and even the training ground sequences have an exquisite grace. The action was balanced by heart. I was concerned Awkwafina would take the humour to campy lows but she truly showed she has some serious dramatic chops. She was not the comic relief! They gave that honour to the Shakespearean stage giant, Ben Kingsley, Our own, homegrown üá®üá¶ Simu Liu was perfect for the part and his performance was world class. I could go on raving but I'll conclude my feedback by saying that this is in every way as powerful a MCU solo representation of Asian culture as BLACK PANTHER was for African culture. I gathered some feedback as I left the theatre, and got ratings of 7.5 (felt it needed more MCU content), 8 (saw many of the things I have just commented on). I've read the criticism that the storytelling was choppy, but I didn't find it so. For me it was more like chapters in a book, completely working together to create a world of content and design. Upon leaving the cinema, I was going to give the movie a 9 (superb) out of 10, but after reflecting on it, I don't know what they could have done to make it better, so, I give this film a 10 (perfect) out of 10. {Superhero Action Adventure}",3 September 2021

emryse,7,Some Underwhelming Parts but very Good on the Whole,"I've been watching Marvel films for years and while I do almost always enjoy them I often come out underwhelmed, Shang Chi actually managed to pleasantly surprise me and while I do think it dragged slightly in the third act I really enjoyed it.

The film manages to balance it's humour and seriousness far better than other marvel property's and also incorporates aspects from other films without feeling too forced, instead adding to the worldbuilding. The action is possibly the best of any Marvel film and obviously takes a lot of influence from Jackie Chan films with I believe the stunt coordinator having worked with Chan in the past. The acting is all good with Simu Liu really shining and while I wasn't a massive fan of Awkwafina's character at the start I did find myself liking her development in the final act, I think Shang Chi manages to take what works so well about the MCU and polish it but this doesn't mean it's without it's flaws.

I did enjoy the emotional link between the villain and Shang Chi, but I thought that there were far too many flash backs telling us of how this relationship has developed, I also think that the third act was a bit of a let down with the action evolving into pretty basic CGI fights and most of the personal edge that lent itself so well to the rivalry between Shang Chi and Win Wu being lost. There are also some big plot holes and things that just don't make sense, the score is underwhelming and I'm not a massive fan of some of the villain's costume designs, however while this film does have it's flaws it was still a very enjoyable movie that I will likely watch again, the cast is good, cinematography different from the usual stuff the MCU has to offer and I like that Marvel didn't shy away from using a lot of subtitles and having characters speaking lot's of Chinese. Very enjoyable and I'd recommend it to any Marvel fan. 7/10.",7 September 2021

ThatMonkey,8,Ring Me up!,"This movie is worthy of praise, it truly represented the people, history and lore of the legend. Early reports said this was the Asian version of Black Panther and that could not be further from the truth. Despite sales, Black Panther was hands down the worst film Marvel released, until Black Widow snatched that crown. You get invested in these characters and had they cast a better side kick other than the unattractive, not funny, Awkwafina I probably would have considered a 9 for the film. I don't know who blessed her with the Asian female Kevin Hart title, but she is awful in everything. I hate her voice, hate acting and her face is 100% Cabage Patch.

I know nothing about these comics, but I truly want to know more about Changs Father and the legacy of the rings. I would assume that will be explored in the sequel, but again, the writer and director deserve praise for how they unfolded and told the story. Phase 4 was not looking promising, but this was aa strong entry and worthy of the same praise Iron Man got. Shang may be the New MCU Poster Boy. The pace probably could have been quickened. At 2:20, it was probably at least 10 minutes minimum too long.

That said, it's a great story, acted and directed well and the only irritant was Awkwafina. Comparing her to Kevin Hart is an insult to Kevin, she is the Asian Female Jerry Lewis and that is one clown I could live a lifetime without having ever seen!",6 September 2021

JoelAlexanderr,8,A gorgeous and thrilling superhero movie with impeccable action,"Disney and Marvel have gotten to the point in their collaboration that much of their projects together seem to look and feel exactly the same. Every time a new movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe comes out, it seems like each filmmaker has to prove that their project is more than just another superhero movie. Luckily, the MCU's newest offering, SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS, stands on its own as a quality action film with some of the best stunt-work and visual effects of the year. The movie is not perfect, and contains some trite ""superhero"" storytelling elements that Disney movies often rely on, but director/writer Destin Daniel Cretton's clear talent behind the camera transforms every average scene into a larger-than-life sequence with high stakes for characters that are easy to invest in.

The first act of the film admittedly plays out similar to many mainstream ""hero's journey"" tales -- an average joe (Shang-Chi) turns out to have a more-than-average calling and must return to his past in order to keep his father from doing evil things that might cause many innocent casualties. It seems like a combination of ideas that have all been done before. The movie is at its weakest when it sets itself up to be as interesting as the concept of the plot, but for SHANG-CHI, the gold is in the execution of this storyline.

Firstly, the characters are interesting from the very start of the movie to the end, so despite the clich√©s the audience still cares about what happens to every character, including the fantastic villains. The comedic relief is also on point throughout, and the characters all feel personable and colorful due to the life that each actor puts into their performances. Simi Liu as Shang-Chi is a star in the making, similar to Chris Evans' turn in the first Captain America film, and casting directors all over Hollywood will likely have him near the top of their call lists after this. The performance of the film for me, however, is Tony Leung as Shang-Chi's father and the primary villain. Leung plays one of the most lived-in and memorable MCU villains since Erik Killmonger -- it is impossible not to feel sympathy for him even though it's clear that he has some serious issues with how he is dealing with his inner demons.

At the end of the day, I believe SHANG-CHI will truly be remembered for the technical mastery put into the action sequences. Only time will tell if this statement remains to be true, but it struck me while watching: this film contains the most well-filmed action sequences of any live-action Marvel movie thus far. A high-stakes fight scene on a bus about 20-30 minutes into the movie made me realize that the filmmakers weren't messing around with their action: the stunt choreography is phenomenal, the visual effects and cinematography are stunning, and the action set pieces are inventive and pay homage to great Asian cinema of the past. The final 30 minutes of SHANG-CHI involve one large final battle, and it ranks as one of my favorite final fight scenes in the MCU along with Avengers: Endgame and Infinity War.

SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is not perfect, especially for those looking for a complete reinvention of what it means to be a superhero movie. It adheres to many of the standards that have already been set up for the genre, but it does so in such a stylish and sleek way that it is difficult not to smile during much of the film. Cretton does a fantastic job helming this movie in a way that sets it apart from the projects that came before it, and ends up crafting the Avatar: The Last Airbender movie that I wish we had. Superhero movies may be running out of ideas, but if they continue to be crafted this well, then we should expect to see plenty more where this came from.

FeastMode,9,my eyes couldn't handle the sheer awesomeness on the screen,"Watch this in IMAX!!!! The entire movie has an expanded aspect ratio. You're watching about 70% of the image on normal screens, plus on way smaller screens with worse speakers. I promise, it's worth it

WOWOWOWOWOW. This movie blew me away. I love it. A LOT. From beginning to end. Everything. I walked out of the movie so hyped, silent-screaming under my mask as i walked to the car. It's been a while since i walked out of a movie this happy. I have so much to say.

I love the MCU (a lot), but there are a few things that are frequently lacking. One of them is good fight scenes. They always have awesome action scenes, but specifically fight scenes are usually pretty good, only great in a few movies like civil war and winter soldier. And in general, fight scenes in American movies pale in comparison to Asian cinema (Ip man, The Raid Redemption, anything Jackie Chan).

The fight scenes in this movie.... how do i describe it... amazing martial arts that's fast but clear, filmed in creative and astonishing ways without a hint of shaky cam or quick cuts, against stunningly beautiful backdrops... phenomenal. And they continuously focus on the fights instead of cutting to a different scene after 10 seconds like i've noticed in the MCU.

This is BY FAR the best fighting in the MCU and it's not even close. Has to be up there with the John Wick series and Netflix's Daredevil as some of the best we've seen in America lately. I loved the first major fight scene so much that i was worried it would be the best one of the movie, far too early. Lol. I be stupid sometimes

Another frequent flaw in the MCU is lack of compelling villain. Nope. Awesome awesome awesome. That's all i'll say.

Another of my frequent complaints is that the musical scores, with some exceptions, don't stand out. I think they heard. They're on a good streak with the shows and Black Widow. It's not as amazing as the Loki score but i liked it. It felt unique to this new franchise.

Still so much more to say, need to go faster. This is one of the best, maybe THE best, story in the MCU, especially the way it's told. I loved all the characters, i loved all the casting choices, i loved the performances. There are scenes of dialogue that gave me goosebumps. All the emotional moments hit. All the callbacks hit. There isn't anything that didn't work for me. There's no such thing as a perfect movie, but mannnnnn.

Lmao i didn't mention the cinematography. Why would i wait this long? It's MESMERIZING. A lot. Throughout. It's candy for your eyes.

It's also nice to see well-written comedy with jokes relevant to the scene and characters, that feels organic. As opposed to the ""insert joke here"" method we've been seeing more of, especially in Far From Home.

What's the opposite of formulaic? That's this movie. I never knew what to expect next (helps that i didn't watch a single trailer, they ruin movies). Definitely doesn't feel like a typical MCU movie. It has it's own unique tone and feel and character.

Continuing what i said in my headline, i have this thing where i get goosebumps and start tearing up, not from an emotional moment, but from a scene being so incredible, especially action scenes. Don't know why it happens, don't know if it happens to other ppl. Maybe it's partly because i can't risk blinking. That happened in this movie numerous times. Like ""this is the coolest thing i've ever seen in my life."" hyperbole, but mannnnn

after endgame finished phase 3 (yes i know spider-man), i was so happy and satisfied with the MCU. But i wasn't sure they could ever recapture that magic again. I knew i would watch everything and it would probably mostly be awesome. But i wasn't expecting top-tier stuff any more. Lol. I be stupid sometimes. I am ecstatic to have that notion obliterated. As of now, this is a top 6 MCU movie for me. Wow

All in all, i adore this movie. You may wonder why i wouldn't give it a 10 after all this raving. 10s are super rare for me, only 13 of them, and i watch thousands of movies. Interstellar, inception, mad max fury road, etc. Movies that shouldn't even be called movies. My 9s are rare too, they are my favorite movies. 10s are my favorites of my favorites. Only superhero movies i've given 10s are dark knight, dark knight rises and civil war.

If you're still reading, wow you're awesome! I think this is my longest review other than Interstellar.

I'm still in such a good mood. I can't wait to watch it again, in IMAX. I want to wait a week so it feels fresher, but i might not be able to! (3 viewings, 9/2/2021, 9/5/2021, 9/22/2021)",3 September 2021

IronMan, GOTG, Black Panther, Thor, and Spiderman Homecoming had better plots but Shang-Chi offered a ton of heart.

The fight scenes were amazingly done and the climax of the film was actually visually beautiful. Some reviews said it was CGI heavy but i actually felt it was just right.

RY4N_HUGH3S,9,Best fight scenes since the raid!?,"I have loved marvel movies since the beginning and the continuous entertainment through the years is phenomenal. Marvel continues to deliver every time!

I was hyped for Shang-Chi since the first trailer, the trailers I would agree don't serve the film true justice, this is because of how little they show you.

The characters are thorough and loveable, the storytelling is delightful and don't even get me started on the action. The action goes against all the issues people say about modern day action films. I believe the fight scenes are up there with the raids. They are choreographed fantastically, they are fast paced and adrenaline pumping.

The theme of the film is sensational and it truly delivers. My only issues with the film is I think the second act can be a bit slow compared to the first and third act. Even with that said there are twists and turns along the way to keep you surprised.

At minimum I believe it is a guarantee you will enjoy this film, Shang-Chi is one of the best, if not the new best solo character marvel movie.

All I can say is if you love fight movies, action movies, marvel movies or fantasy films. This is for you. Even if you aren't big on them this film will by minimum give you a good time.

I miss these type of movies focusing more on the physical aspect of fighting turning it into an art-form, and more of a struggle to force the character to master the skill in perfection before attempting to use it. The result of failure in physical fights are more deadly and the stakes are higher.

Surprisingly, this move had a lot of soul I missed from other older similar movies and a rich landscape of interesting characters and creatures.

jamesl2061-683-328126,6,Unmarvelling,"I'll be brief.

Clearly much effort, thought and funding has gone into this flick but it only goes to show that one can assemble all the right ingredients in a recipe and still make a meal of it.

It has good action, but the live action CG is stale and the transitions always evident.

It has a solid storyline, but the padding is average.

There are good characters, who are not without mistakes and weaknesses. Besides I loved the storyline, the characters, the acting, and loved the music. I do not give a damn about the colour of the actors skin in any of the films. It is an awesome film, thats all.",2 September 2021
RvBreukie,2,A very big Meh while it could have been soooo much more,"For starters, the cinematography and the CGI are pretty nice. However that's where the positive ends.

The fighting choreography is ok, not bad but not great at all. For example even Mortal Combat did it way better with way less. Also it follows the usual marvel formula of a lot of CGI in the fighting scenes, but this time they blew of the roof with it making those scenes feel completely detached from the world they're in.

Concerning the characters, Shang-Chi isn't really there for most parts of the movie, taking a few steps back in his very own movie. A lot of things that other characters did in their time in the spotlight should have been done by him, there was no reason for him to not do those things. Causing him to be a neglected in his own movie, basically a background character. As for the female leads, one is just plain annoying and really serves no purpose(you'll know instantly when she appears). The other is an over-the-top strong woman actually getting most of the screentime, which don't get me wrong the actress acts nicely, but the way she is presented in the story and the way her character has come to be and is established is just unnatural and feels like she's just someone who has activated IRL-cheats, it just feels like they took a real shortcut with her character whilst there was so much they could've done to make her really likeable and immersable for you as a viewer. However the way they handled her just makes her feel like a 2D cardboard character that used cheats to max her stats.

As for the story and dialogue. The story is just abyssmal, really lacking in content and feels like something a hungover student would drum up last-minute after a late night party. The dialogue feels wooden most of the time, just really unnatural and don't even get me started on the ""humor"" which is overly forced and just really bad.

It feels like a movie that knows what it wants to do, but not how it wants to do that and just goes at it in a dozen ways leaving to much clutter and sidesteps for it to feel like a coherent story. If only they had chosen 1 or 2 things and stuck with them it could have been a decent flick.",5 September 2021

I like Ben Kingsley, but what was his character doing in the movie? - it was completely out of place and had a ridiculous story line as to why he was there. However it did add the funniest part to the movie where he thought the apes in the original Planet of the Apes films were actually apes. My wife, who is a big MCU fan, also thought it was poor.

gullymark,10,Phase 4 in the MCU has a bright future,"My review.. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings has easily joined my top 10 list of the best movies I've ever seen... just like that. Marvel has created another masterpiece alongside Black Panther with excellent cinematography, A-1 story telling from the origin, to the subtle demolishing of Asian American stereotypes, the cameos that bring the marvel universe into unity, and even to the timing of the comic relief. These characters knew the assignment and delivered top tier performances in the choreography, plus the VFX was on Snyder's team level, imo. Arguably the best Marvel movie to date. But also one of the best Kung Fu movies in its own lane. This new Phase in the saga has a bright future if they're coming in this hot. Let me find out, Spider Man.

rannynm,10,Most Mystical and Beautiful Movie In History!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the most mystical and beautiful movie in history! The music, the special effects and the acting all take you to another world. The film leaves you wanting a Morris of your own.

The storyline follows a young man named Shang-Chi (Simu Liu). His father is a one thousand-year-old man and conqueror nicknamed The Mandarin (Tony Leung Chiu-wai), who has only ever used the infamous and all-powerful Ten Rings for evil. When the Mandarin is set to unleash infinite evil on the universe, Shang-Chi has to stop his father.

This movie is a cinematic experience. The fighting and choreography are out of this world. The long slow motion shots make the audience feel as if they are in a video game. Simu steals the show; every fight scene is flawless with his fluid movements and it proves just how hard he worked on his character for this film. Every audience falls in love with Shang-Chi; he's funny, with perfect comedic timing and he knows the balance between peace and violence. He encapsulates what the majority of young adults feel - like not being able to find their place in the world. The movie makes fans feel as if they've known Shang for years. It has wonderful flashbacks, which give the audience glimpses of his past, his pain and how his fears have shaped who he is. The film gives a wonderful all-around scope of this character that feels like a friend we've known all our life. It makes fans excited to see Shang-Chi again. Shang and his sister Xu Xialing are an iconic duo. They're both powerful and, while there's some tension due to their past, they put everything aside and let love shine through. Xialing is a role model, officially joining the Marvel Cinematic Universe's most powerful women. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is perfect for AAPI (Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders) representation in cinema. It represents Chinese culture powerfully, shows what it's like to be an Asian-American in modern day USA, not to mention that Simu is Marvel Studios' first Asian-American superhero. Simu and Shang-Chi are writing history while also inspiring children and fans all around the world. The film delivers on all grounds; the cameos are shocking and leave you on the edge of your seat. Trying not to shout during the two post credits scenes prove to be a challenge. By the end of the movie, I wanted to sing the song ""Hotel California"" at the top of my lungs.

This film reminds you to search for who you are and let your past guide you to who you want to be. Ever since his mother died, Shang has been trained by his father to use violence. When he arrives at his mother's village, he learns how to find peace within himself and the world around him. He learns to trust himself and to use the rings for good.

I give Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18 plus adults. It is available only in theaters September 3, 2021. By Heather S., KIDS FIRST!",4 September 2021

kuner-59029,2,Bad acting in a nauseating CGI crapfest,"The first thing that jumps out at you here is how uneven the acting is compared to the usual Marvel movies. Actors alternate between overacting, pathos and subdued attempts at coolness. Add the usual Marvel style self-referential wink wink humor, and the obligatory 30 minute CGI showdown with purple light themed villains and monster (for the... 15th time now?), and you end up with a jarring, nauseating tonal mess of a movie.

It's the same movie over and over again, same exact story beats, same pacing, same style soundtrack, same jokes, same trashy special effects laden battle at the end.

They tried to gimmick things up with Kung Fu here (because that's apparently what Disney think people want to see in movies with an Asian cast), but you've seen it all before dozens of times, and better at that. The martial arts fight in public transport has been done to death (recently quite well in ""Nobody"", but also in Marvel films like Captain Marvel), and in general the fights pale against movies like Matrix, John Wick or any Jackie Chan classic.

The reality is that Marvel movies feel dated and played out, with nowhere to go except from one CGI battle to the next. Maybe Marvel would be better off switching to a series format, because the movies are just reheated microwave dinners at this point.

Save your money for something original.",4 September 2021
PhatManBad,5,"Computerized Atmosphere, Dull Story and Characters, A Few Good Parts","Awkwafina should not be the most interesting part of your $150 million kung fu movie.

She wasn't great (sometimes she was a bit annoying, to be honest), but everyone else was forgettable. Shang-Chi himself was the generic ""slacker with potential"" character with no personality. And he was a live wire compared to the rest of the cast. Aside from Awkwafina, the others seemed to have picked one emotion (either stoic, angry, stern, or ""wise"") and stuck with it.

Wait a minute, I forgot about Ben Kingsley. His appearance was a nice surprise (I think), but he was a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick with an awful-looking CGI pet monster (who was also a wacky Disney animated movie sidekick).

Shang-Chi strikes me as an American-friendly martial arts movie. Not that I'm an expert on kung fu movies, but I've watched enough movies (including several Marvel movies) to know a factory-made action flick when I see it. The movie is very watered down.

There was, for instance, no effort involved in developing a plot or telling a story whatsoever. It's almost the exact same plot as the CW's Kung Fu series. Family vs. Family.

I wanted to enjoy the fight scenes (I can tell that a lot of effort was put into them), but everything looked fake. Obvious special effects mixed with artificial movie sets. The final battle was two giant cartoons wrestling each other.

As a matter of fact, almost every scene in the movie was covered in computer graphics.

I didn't hate the movie. I can see other people liking it. But I was bored most of the time.",5 September 2021
darkreignn,5,Follows the exact same formula as every other Marvel film,"""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" follows the same formula that's presented to audiences in any typical Marvel film; with that said, ""Shang-Chi"" gives you exactly what you expect, for better or for worse. There are no tricks up this movie's sleeve - there are no surprises. This film delivers a standard, well-executed superhero film, and whether or not you enjoy that will be completely up to you.

I, for one, am sick of the standard Marvel setup; I admit I have superhero fatigue, and unfortunately, ""Shang-Chi"" follows that typical superhero setup to a T - what that means is an extremely bland film both in character and plot, with only a few sparks of light along that tease a more compelling movie. The best parts of ""Shang-Chi"" involve Tony Chiu-Wai Leung; he plays a surprisingly complex and sympathetic villain and stars in some scenes that echoed the badassery of Asian gangster flicks. One scene where he takes out a room full of villains was so intense that I wish the movie would've followed that plot line instead of the subpar narrative we were left with. So, yes, Tony is great - everything else in ""Shang-Chi"" is mediocre, including the titular hero.

Iron-Man. Spider-Man. Black Widow. The Hulk. Dr. Strange. These are all Marvel superheroes that you can immediately picture because of their distinctiveness as characters. Black Widow is the sexy, badass assassin. Spider-Man is the naive but pure hearted schoolboy. Iron-Man is the cocky billionaire. Shang-Chi? He's the, um, actually, who is he? That's exactly what you'll be asking yourself because Shang-Chi barely has a personality in this film - his character is so dull and forgettable. And me saying that is in no way a slight to Simu Liu, because he's fine in the role; it's the script that does him no favors. When it comes to other characters, Awkwafina was in this movie, and I honestly was excited to see her in this because of how good she was in ""The Farewell."" And wow, my excitement was led astray because she was about as fun and entertaining as a prostate exam. I mean, sweet Jesus, she was so grating that I considered stuffing popcorn into my ears so I didn't have to listen to her speak anymore. Her jokes weren't funny, her dialogue was awful (I'm sure most of it was improvised), and her character was just plain annoying.

""Shang-Chi"" was also a very boring film, stuffed with poor dialogue and loads of exposition that had me nodding off in the theatre. A lot of lines were so cheesy, and so poorly delivered, that I found myself rolling my eyes. ""Shang-Chi"" also has the same amount of bland, uncreative editing and filming that is present in a lot of Marvel films - characters walk from room to room, and talk about this subject and that subject. It's not fun, it's not entertaining, and let's face it, it's horrendously boring. But okay, you're willing to look past that if the action is good, I get it! So how was the action?

The first act of this movie does have two good action sequences, and you've seen them both in the trailer - the bus fight, and the scaffolding fight. I hope you're not that big a fan of Kung-Fu, because after those two fights, you will no longer get well-choreographed action and will instead be treated to horrific CGI battles. I'm talking ring-on-ring action and unnecessary giant monster fights that had no place or purpose in this movie. And it's all boring to watch. I mean, you have basically the first ever Kung-Fu superhero movie, and you decide to only include two scenes of Kung-Fu? What were the creators thinking?

""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" was an exercise in disappointment. Instead of attempting to do something different, the film does exactly what you'd expect. And hey, if you love these kind of movies, you'll most likely love this film, and that's great - I hope you do. But if you're at all tired by the exact same formula that all superhero movies follow, ""Shang-Chi"" won't manage to lull you out of your superhero fatigue.",5 September 2021

Plot follow a simple acceptance plot, of Shang learning to accept he is his father's son, with no surprising twists or changes to the plot to make it better. Shang himself seems to be watching everything instead of actually interacting with his world. Action scenes were choreographed well, yet never seemed to fit for some reason. The ending was anticlimactic, and I expected more of a ending fight with the big bad. Visually speaking the movie is gorgeous, but i wouldn't watch it for the visuals. Shang as a character is bland and boring. The only character I felt was developed well was Shang's Father. Side characters are forgettable. If you are a fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then don't watch it as it doesn't fit at all in the timeline, with excessive fantasy elements that don't fit in the universe.

Dello_,4,Boring,"I was really hoping to like Shang-Chi but I couldn't because of mainly three reasons: the first one is the most severe and it is the fact that I found myself very bored, especially in the last hour. I spent that time hoping that I could have the ability to skip 10 second at will like on YouTube. The second problem is the fact that Shang-Chi itself is not an interesting character as far as this movie treats him. He surely has potential and it is clear that Marvel will be high on him in the future and I still have hope but in this movie I think I preferred at least four characters more than him and he is the protagonist. And finally the plot has various holes, especially regarding the Ten Rings as a criminal organization. The visuals and the action are good but it wasn't enough for me to like this movie.

subxerogravity,9,The Master of kung fu was really good but not as good as I wanted it to be.,"It was better than the proceeding Marvel movie Black Window. More exceeding the expectations of a Marvel movie. Shang-Chi feels like the marvel movie experience is starting to get back to the normal of the theme ride Martian Scorsese believes they are (I can't disagree, just note that's what I want)

In comparison Shang-Chi is a lower level character. I am a fan of Marvel comics but got more of the references to the Marvel Cinematic Universe in this movie than to the direct comic book references. Those Marvel cinematic universe references were amazing enough to get over the fact that the obvious comic book ones went over my head. I mean this movie's connection to other movies is great fanfare that makes me love it more. So really cool cameos happen that actually move the story along.

I did like what they did with the Mandarin here but do feel they copied and paste a lot of things into the story of Shang-Chi to make a complete movie for a lower level character. From the little I know of the character he more fits into those Netflix's shows they did a few years back but change him enough to justify a blockbuster.

They did succeed in making Shang-Chi's background more fuller. The relationship between him and his father and sister was beautiful, complex and more importantly, never bored me and of course Awkafina as the comedy relief and best friend to Shang-Chi was strategic gold. The story for the background was not that full. It's really a character driven movie for without the amazing performances from a group of actors who know their stuff this story would fall short.

Note, I loved the fact that Michelle Yeoh was in this movie and that gives it a lot, but she's done way better in less effective films (but she most likely got a huge paycheck from Disney just to wave her hands around).

The special effects were good in this flick. I was impress with what was used to make the final conflict and I was convince that the dude from Kim's Convenience was a master of kung fu

Its a good movie but it did not live up to my high expectations of it. It gave me a lot of cool things but really did not give me anything I did not see before, in movies that did it better, but if it's about anything I did spend the rest of the day pretending I knew Kung fu.",4 September 2021
imysticalbliss,10,Amazing movie!! Looking forward to the next one.,"It honestly shocks me on how many people would give this movie a low rating. Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is one of the best films that has come out this year. This film has a lot of action, comedy and has soul. I felt very connected to this film. It's very unique and the actors performed very well. The cinematography, visuals were crafted beautifully and the music composition worked wonderfully together. A lot of hard work has been put into this film and it definitely shows. This movie deserves the rating it gets from me and I'll be seeing this again tomorrow.",4 September 2021
mfriesen-96359,10,An all around great movie üëç,"This is a visually stunning movie. With great action scenes and fabulous fights. The Asian and Asian American representation hits home for me, being a half Asian Canadian. And the comedy is there, when needed. There is also a nice addition of female power in the movie, that isn't too overwhelming, like the all female fight scenes in endgame and infinity war(no hate just my opinion). This is for sure a must see movie for action movie, marvel, or even just movie fans.",4 September 2021

Jeremy_Urquhart,8,"More movies like this, please, Marvel","Thought I was feeling some Marvel fatigue after WandaVision (which started strong but ended on a bit of a whimper) and Black Widow (which wasn't terrible, but two months later I can't remember anything about it except how Florence Pugh was cool in it), but this one has rejuvenated some of my enthusiasm for the unstoppably huge MCU.

There's a satisfying origin story here, with a few small appearances from familiar characters that add spice to a host of new characters who are all quite compelling right out of the gate.

The action's great, and there's also so much of it- I liked how lots of the action felt relatively grounded by MCU standards, with neat stunt work and exciting camerawork making the action pop (it's only the final battle that gets really CGI heavy).

The humour's also more consistent than most Marvel films, with most of the jokes landing. Also cool were all the fantasy elements and creatures- they were all pretty inventive and well-executed.

I will say the one notable flaw is that there's a lot of exposition in the film's second half, but they get around that a little by having great actors like Tony Leung and Michelle Yeoh do most of the explaining (and there is a lot to explain, with this being a whole new side of the MCU and all), so it's not super noticeable.",28 September 2021
sartakk,10,SUPER AMAZINGGG!!,"Before getting into any of the review stuff. Congratulations to the whole cast and crew of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.

This film is unlike any other Marvel project however, this was an absolute wonder.

The potrayal of the every character was flawless. Perfectly casted each and every person.

Visually very engaging. I loved the CGI it was amazing.

The Chinese Culture was very well demonstrated which was a beautiful scene to watch.

People should definitely go and watch this... It's worth the Theatre Experience.

Very well done Marvel Studios with this film.

Even though the pandemic is hampering with the Collection... I feel like this has been a blockbuster.

Once again congratulations to the entire cast and crew.

eddie_baggins,8,A Marvel-ous martial arts joy,"Showing no signs of slowing down hot off the heels of Black Widow, a raft of well-received Disney+ series and arriving not too far in front of the hotly anticipated The Eternals, Marvel continues to put in work that puts many other wheelhouses too shame, with the marital arts infused Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, yet another entry into the brands increasingly loaded catalogue of quality blockbuster releases.

It's hard to pinpoint exactly what Marvel keep doing to maintain the momentum that started all those years ago with 2008's Iron Man, it's absolutely correct when many say a lot of these origin stories and event pictures follow a very set formula from A to B, but with an ability to attract some of the best actors working in the industry today and handpicking a raft of some of the most exciting Hollywood filmmakers around, Marvel have once more struck gold with the incredibly fun and inventive Shang-Chi.

Quite possibly the most visually sumptuous Marvel film yet, sometimes feeling as if Marvel has meet with Ang Lee/Yimou Zhang and in my mind the Marvel film that features the best choregraphed action scenes yet from the spectacle heavy brand, Shang-Chi is a big screen blast that is freshly directed by the upcoming Destin Daniel Cretton who here has got his just rewards after his great debut Short Term 12 and the sadly undervalued The Glass Castle came before this big-budgeted ride.

Infusing his film with a great energy and charm that is enhanced by the work of leads Simu Liu (in a career launching turn) as our likable hero Shaun/Shang-Chi, Awkwafina (doing her usual but fun schtick) as Shaun's bestie Katy and Tony Leung as the unfortunate villain of the piece Xu Wenwu, Cretton has turned out to be the perfect choice to start off the cinematic journey of the fist swinging Shang-Chi and helps instill in his film some nice differences to what we've come to expect from comic book blockbusters of the modern era.

Most notably for the film is the exciting use of hand to hand combat that is delivered spectacularly in two stand out sequences on board a moving bus and then bettered alongside a high rise building in Macau, both these set pieces are easily some of the most noteworthy of any Marvel film yet while also benefiting the film other than its Asian infused eccentricities is the fun relationship between Shang-Chi and Katy than never bothers with adding extra baggage to add weight to their believable and fun friendship.

If there was a major drawback to Shang-Chi's many wins it is in an overdrawn finale, a major problem many have acknowledged previously when it comes to Marvel films, Cretton and his team can't quite stick the landing for Shang-Chi with it being a little too long in the tooth for its own good and slightly overblown and while it features some incredible imagery and technical wizardry, the films rip-roaring start and strong middle section gives way too something lesser.

Final Say -

Another huge win for Marvel who have here with the help of director Destin Daniel Cretton and his talented cast, created an instantly likable cinematic universe that provides the comic kings with one of their most unique and exciting playgrounds yet.

dilipbts,9,Shang-chi and the legend of the ten rings,"I have just watched this movie. I am an avid Marvel fan. This film introduces a new character, there is that standard Disney approach, with a mix of comedy, seriousness and lots of action.

Disney work through the numbers on this film, there are no surprises and it does what it does on the tin.

The acting is good, special effects are solids and the story is not bad.

There's continuity linking to the other marvel universe which is nice for the fans.

I would actually pitch this at 7.5/10, not quite an 8 but higher than a 7

Those review of 1 or 2 out of ten are way off the mark, this film is not that bad.",19 September 2021
iamdennisjoseph,10,Shang Chi The Best Marvel Movie or MCU's Phase 4,"A solid origin story for MCU's newest Avenger.

If I were to summarize how this movie made me feel, I would say it was like a crossover of Raya and the Last Dragon, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and a mega blockbuster Jackie Chan film but with the never-tiring humor of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. For the first time in forever, I didn't need English subtitles for English conversations in an MCU film. Thank God for Asian-Americans haha.

I want to leave out Simu Liu and Shang-Chi himself in this review because I think this movie is more about Tony Leung's character, the Mandarin, than it is about Shang-chi. This movie's central themes are grief, loss, moving on and finding passion in life. All these are heavier and deeper with The Mandarin than with Shang-chi. This film is like a beloved ancient Asian tale brought to life, crafted with respect and participated by the probably the best people for their roles.

So many familiar faces appear in this movie, and it is always nice to remember which films in the franchise you saw some characters in and how they are all connected with each other.

I am so excited for what Shang-chi can offer from here on out to the rest of the MCU. Asians really are winning with this representation in the Avengers. This movie is a homage to many superhero fans who are Asian. Asian kids finally have superheroes in the MCU they can see themselves in.",19 September 2021
chrisummerer,8,Beatiful,null,19 September 2021
jagesara,8,What Marvel does best,"Review of ""SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE 10 RINGS"". The newest from Marvel and what a sensational one ! Technical fight-scenes, strong Martial Arts/Kung Fu, lots of humor, elegant moves and original language. Our main hero and heroine are Chinese, so we can expect some traditional karaoke scenes and perhaps a dragon or two. Based on one of the Marvel Comics, let's leave it to that, there's no need to compare the book with the film. Just enjoy both.

The story itself is a classic love story, the things we do for Love. But as always we have the battle between good or bad and the grey area in between. Whoever owns the 10 rings will be the master of his fate. Invincible and troubled at the same time. Power comes with responsibility.

This must be the 12th time for me to fall in love with Tony Leung, all over again. Such a charismatic actor (from the film ""In the mood for love"") as always intense and charming. His intriguing smile is a trigger to be more careful. It's an exclusive quality. Is he serious or are you the next victim? No doubt, he's always in control of every character he plays. Here, he's the badass, Xu Wenwu, with a big lust for power and he has the 10 rings to help him achieve this never ending hunger for more. But there's more to him than just being strong headed and bold. When he meets his opponent, a female force so overwhelming , it awakens tenderness and modesty in our villain. That's how you win, use the yin-yang, it works every time. There's more to Life than just battle and gaining power. Victory has many shades and combined with Love, Life becomes paradise. However, this is a huge action movie, so brace yourself for lots of twists in the storyline, with surprising animals and hidden secrets in some people's hearts. They are all fighting an inner-battle, holding grudges and making the same mistakes every time. Why are they hurting inside? We have to look at the ghosts from the past , because ""you can't outrun who you really are''. And that's the centre of all the action. Our hero Chang/Shaun has a troubled journey ahead, becoming himself, restoring his given powers, reconciling the past with the present in order to obtain the balance of the world. And that's exactly what Marvel does best !! With beautiful fight-scenes, all fully orchestrated with calculated blows and kicks, such graceful, exquisite and delicate moves. Like a perfect dance. And who else than Michelle Yeoh, our Martial Arts-diva (from ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon '') who has elevated her profession to an allround level. It's such a pleasure to watch her in fight-scenes, she has an elegant and experienced style. New star on the horizon is the other fighter Xia Ling, she has the badass attitude, it comes natural to her. She delivered great action.

The women fighters are equally blessed with skills (usually in chinese historical drama), with the exception of Awkwafina (plays Shaun's pengyou/friend), she has other know-how and she's good at it. So no need to compare, if you put all efforts together, there might be a chance to defeat the enemy.

Tony Leung has such an important character here, his acting is quite impressive and in a pleasant way he takes the limelight from our hero, who seems okay with it. Not sure it's because of the storyline, or his status, or even his image on the poster. He's literally the boss there. That's probably the power of the 10 rings, whoever wears them will rule the world. But beware of jealous competition and deceit in the name of Love. Even in the Marvel Universe rings are magical, centred around great powers and endless possibilities. They are worth living or dying for. All in all, a very interesting and action packed movie. Very entertaining, very smashing/thrashing and a very good one for a date-night. Or see it with your friends/family. Enjoy the ride ! MUST SEE !!",19 September 2021
jcsallows,7,Welcome to the Marvel Family...again...,"I'm not going to downplay this movie for it's action, visuals and comedy (but not as much comedy as you'd expect from a Marvel movie). If you just want an entertaining movie, I think the MCU has figured that much out at this point. Oddly enough, Awkwafina is the best part of this movie. I like her better in this than other things I've seen her in.

The main character, Shang-Chi, really sells this movie. Simu Liu knocks it out of the park with his perfomance. He knows how to play an everyman. His chemistry with Awkwafina works well and are the best scenes in the movie. I thought it was interesting that, like many other marvel characters, he's a superhero who could be a regular guy walking down the street. You wouldn't know unless you knew his backstory (and believed it). I also liked the whole transition where he faces his true identity in finally confronting his father (the main antogonist).

So the weakpoints, it's just as you'd expect. The villain is about as 2-dimensional as it gets. I didn't really care for him even as the credits rolled. The fact that he was Shang-Chi's father is literally the only thing making him relevant to the story or remotely interesting. Even the whole Ten Rings super power didn't completely sell me. It looked cool but beyond that, it was a guy with metal rings on his arms...which makes him...the most powerful man in world history? Sure, whatever.

The other (and I would say biggest) weakpoint is the story. Like I began this review, this has great visuals, action and is a generally entertaining movie. BUT...I can't help but think there are Marvel screenwriters who are copy/pasting stories from previous Marvel movies. The third act was borderline ripped from Black Panther. It's a shame because I think this movie, in a vacuum, is really something special without elements feeling regurgitated from the MCU's back catalogue.

Look, I get it. Sometimes you want the same thing. I'm not going to stop you from watching Marvel, Pixar and Disney cartoon movies (or their live-action remakes). But I personally have never heard of Shang-Chi from the comics, barely knew of most of these actors and just feel less invested than I was pre-Avengers: Endgame. It feels odd waiting for X-Men, Deadpool, Wolverine, Iron Fist, Fantastic 4, Blade, New Avengers and others to join the MCU but we're watching this while we wait. Do we need this many MCU movies? I guess that's not for me to decide.",19 September 2021

csmaros,7,"Enjoyable, but Disneyfied","Felt more like a Disney production than a MCU movie. The supernatural aspects especially seem like they were sourced from a Disney workflow.

Good character development, especially for the Mandarin, but some stuff seemed glossed over. The final ""Boss Battle"" was a bit of CGI overload, at least for me. Much more than any other MCU movie.

Despite my specific picks at the movie, it's very enjoyable. From an Americana perspective, I'd put it a bit below Black Panther. At the time of this review words have been said that makes any followup of this movie questionable at best.

There are two trailers, one middle, one ending. Interesting fluff but not important. Especially since such a followup may not happen.",15 September 2021
danielmanson,8,Unique. But a very fun film,"I have to say I was looking forward to this one. First film in a while that had no connection to avengers etc so I was intrigued to see how they would do this. And on the whole it was very enjoyable and fun to watch!

First instincts when watching were a little mixed. It was an odd start to say the least and didn't have any idea how this was going to go. And my first instincts on Katy were also mixed. I felt like they were trying to force the humour out on her and I found her character really annoying. HOWEVER..

Once it gets going the film gets better and better. Katy becomes a great character and all the characters development and arcs on a whole were truly phenomenal! For me the best part of the film was the characters and seeing them all develop throughout.

So is the plot good? To be blunt, yes! It's truly unique and uniquely done in so many ways, I don't want to give out anything that would spoil anything, but it's really not what you expect. That's all I say!



I'll shut up now! I'll just say it's well worth watching. It's a great ""superhero"" to have and a great one to watch. And overall it's a fun, visually pleasing and brilliant watch. I recommend.",14 September 2021
benm-41751,7,"A fun, entertaining, visually stunning, and heartfelt repeat of the same tired formula","As far as superhero movies retreading the same ground over and over like a pizza slicer struggling to cut through a dull crust, particularly in the current climate of overdone and overrated Marvel movies, Shang-Chi stands on its own as a very fun and endearing film. It takes you on a rollercoaster from humble jokes between friends to fighting brutes on a bus to eventually the epic battle you expected. Compared to some Marvel movies which are now feeling to make care about who I'm supposed to be cheering for in the first place, Shang-Chi is a much more likeable and worthy movie.

In carrying out this formula, I think the movie does it perfectly. And I came to like the characters enough to be invested and enchanted by the events. The Chinese flavour of the movie helps to give it more rhythm and depth, at least on the surface level.

Still, at the end of the day, this is another overbudgeted blockbuster action movie which makes less sense the further along you watch. Given how tight the first half of the movie is, I did find myself taken out of it by the insertion of Trevor Slattery and the obligatory ""cute little critter that knows everything"" moment. And while the inevitable final battle was very well done and exhilarating, it still exchanged logic and gravity for another slog through a chaotic battlefield of good versus evil. I also wished that Shang-Chi's father would start to make sense by the end of the movie, because he seemed enigmatic and layered at the beginning but came across as a stereotypical tyrant dad by the end.

So overall, I'd say this movie is definitely worth a watch (and worth the hype) in the sea of superhero movies. It leads the pack in that bunch, but doesn't stray from it - for better and worse.",14 September 2021

deothor,7,Beware of hundreds of fake reviews praising this movie to heavens and beyond. Here's my take on Shang Chi.,"This movie is both fine, yet very flawed. The first issue is pacing. It's quite exhausting. Action-break-flashback-action-flashback-action-break-break-break-flashback-action. It's as if you tried to first sprint, then suddenly halt and tip-toe-walk and then run a marathon only to sprint again.

Second issue are flashbacks. This movie is riddled with them. And I don't mind them.. Unless they keep on returning to exactly the same scene over and over and over again with that difference that you get to listen to new part of the talk. I don't remember any other movie that was so riddled with flashbacks.

Third issue are fights. Now this has to be broken in 2 groups; ""magical fights"" and ""down to earth fights"". The first was done terribly. Camera shake, way too close, badly lighted and confusing as heck. There was some vision, some idea, yes, but it turned into ""cgi slosh"". This could have been done oh-so-much better.. But we got pointless confusing close-ups then camera shaky-shaky moments instead. The second group reminds me of jackie chan movies, you know.. kung-fu stuff, which was great... To some extend.

Fourth issue is main character. He's the extend from point earlier. He's like blank-slate punching bag in this show. He has no real emotions and just goes with the flow. He >never< speaks his mind and rather just silently mumbles his agreement for whatever plan others come up with. It was annoying. Really grating. Ok, I don't mind if MC is not an iron man of a character. But I had seen corpses put more action while being decomposing than Shang chi. Also he gets beaten pretty much all the time. There are only 3'ish exceptions where he shows real emotions. And again.. shoddy pacing cripples them slightly.

The Second character, his friend - Katey (i think).. she was fine. She was active and I couldn't shake this feeling that she's the brains of the team with witty humor, while he's broody muscle man with past.

There were few amazing scenes, which i loved alot, really. But beyond that it was just mediocre. Thank god it was ""just"" mediocre, considering what things marvel relases lately. Mediocre is fine. Really. Tiresome, extended to the point of exhausting... But fine! A (not so) solid 7!

Oh also, there are quite a few plot holes and whatnot ranging from minor (assassins using stun weapons ONLY - lol) to extreme (spoilery stuff).. but at this point.. i just can't even bother. Just roll my eyes and force my brain to stop thinking about it. To become a script writer in 202x all you need to know is how to sniff glue with class and how to agree to everything corporate monkeys in expensive suits tell you.

Should you watch it? If Marvel fan.. you already seen it. If you aren't marvel fan, but still enjoy sci-fi/fantasy... Eh... Not like there's anything better to do I guess.",12 September 2021

Simu Liu as the lead is a welcoming addition to the Marvel family with his martial arts skills and adds more to this ever-growing universe.

The visuals, the fight choreography, and an interesting soundtrack to boot! It makes you think this is more like a martial arts fantasy film rather than a typical Marvel movie. I also took notice of the moral values and quirks usually seen in Asian families that it began to remind me of the most recent film Crazy Rich in a way in terms of valuing your heritage and roots, but learning that your past doesn't dictate what you should become many years later.

At 2019 San Diego Comic-Con, Simu Liu spoke about what it's like to be part of Marvel. He was so humble to speak of it. After what I've seen in this movie, it makes sense on why he said at the panel of him citing Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman (respect) as an influence in taking on this lead role. Chadwick helped open that door for him, he took it, and made it his own for audiences who look like him.

It was good to see a major blockbuster from a non-USA centric point of view. Shang Chi's best movements are it's timed humour and martial arts fight scenes. The ending of the movie is a theme park ride with eye soaring VFX of two dragons which are supposedy fighting but we don't know it due to excess use of colour.

You got action, fight scenes, CG, and a decent share of jokes here and there. But beyond that, Shang Chi is another wasted opportunity, because the plot is so shallow it really makes no sense. I never quite get why Shang Chi hated his dad so much, nor exactly what his dad's feeling is towards his kids. The plot takes you whatever way is convenient to get to the next big scene, and there is no character development or even any consistency. Nevertheless if you are fine with an action adventure roller coaster and don't care about acting or story telling, this one fits the bi. Solid 7 from me.",4 September 2021

lucaslw-93145,9,"Huge movie, a great addition to Phase 4","Black Widow kicked off Phase 4 with relatively muted excitement. Blame BW's performance on the pandemic, pirating, whatever. But for a movie that's several years overdue and months delayed, it was an underwhelming opening to the next step of the MCU both in story quality and action directing.

Shang-Chi does a lot of heavy lifting and bounces Phase 4 back to Marvel's in-form output with one of the strongest Origin-Story films yet. A combination of a great cast and actor chemistry, palatable plot and storytelling, and the vibrant beauty of Chinese & Chinese-American culture interwoven naturally into the interactions between characters makes Shang-Chi an incredibly fun film for anyone not up-to-date on the MCU and an instant favorite for any die-hard MCU fans. And yet, even with each strong component that this film brings to the table, the most noteworthy highlight is that Shang-Chi has managed to seamlessly adapt Kung Fu choreography into the BEST hand-to-hand fight choreography that the MCU has ever seen. (Yes, in my opinion, it's better than the fight choreo from CA:Winter Soldier; that's no small feat). The action sequences here, backed by a well-fitting and punchy soundtrack make the action of Shang-Chi almost as exciting as that of the best Avengers movies.

Not a perfect film by any means, some of the story elements are not fully developed and we also have the scheduled 3rd act CGI battle that seems to come with every MCU movie. Even so, the highs certainly outweigh the lows and in all, highly recommend seeing this movie. My thoughts are too cluttered by the awe inspired by the movie so a quick recap of the pros:",7 September 2021
gastonregatense,9,"Shang-Chi, Marvel's Black Horse","Shang-Chi is a movie that nobody expected. An exemplar with which we were not familiar that, not only knew how to exploit their low expectations to the maximum extent, but also developed a structured and dynamic narrative immersed in a MCU that does not leave much room for new heroes.

Shang-Chi made its first appearance in Steve Englehart and Jim Starlin's ""Special Marvel Edition # 15"" (December 1973). A Kung-Fu master created in the middle of the genre's boom in the US in the 1970s, Shang-Chi is quite a quirky character.

Played by Simu Liu, the protagonist is embarked on an adventure after being intercepted by ghosts from his past. Full of action, martial arts and a very own and attractive aesthetic, the film unfolds without delay. The scenes are punctual and always add something new. Even with a sense of humor that can get heavy on certain occasions (such as when Katy makes jokes in the middle of life and death situations), Shang-Chi finds its essence, exploits it and ends with a gold ribbon leaving the door open for future aftermath.

Marvel and its production team never cease to amaze me with their new films. In a difficult transition period, given the conclusion of the Infinity Saga and the beginning of this new phase, the studio keeps its feet on the ground and continues a coherent thread of its interconnected universe. Regardless of the obvious mentions to the events of ""Avengers Endgame"", Marvel returns to do what it does best: including thousands of references, cameos and winks that leave the geeks like me open-mouthed and with the greed for more.

The cast is incredible. I did not know any of the actors beforehand and they all dazzled me with their distinctive personalities and professional interpretations. The studio made a great work in synthetizing the oriental culture¬¥s mythology and beliefs. However, it is true that Shang-Chi continues to be a westernized vision of Asian cultures due to its falls into stereotypes of martial arts and frequent characterizations of the Eastern world in Hollywood. Despite this and to my surprise, Shang-Chi knows how to combine the best of both worlds, using humor as its best tool and taking its time to tell the story, avoiding the rush to get to the action sequences that movies of this kind have suffered The protagonist's arc is round and fulfilling. It has cohesion and is true to its ideals from beginning to end. Thus, the villain (excellently played by Tony Leung) only contributes to the plot and does not fall into the corner of un-memorable Marvel villains. We send you a greeting, Fake Mandarin. If it hadn't been for the blessing acting skills of RDJ, no one would remember your existence.

Furthermore, the film interprets the concept of ""grays"" very well. In a franchise that is ""infantilized"" at times, Shang-Chi does not stutter in telling the hard truths of reality such as unsatisfactory employment, unreal family expectations, childhood trauma, the dilemma about murder, among others. Heroes are not pure white. They have their shortcomings, they fight with their demons and that makes them more credible, more human.

With a stellar sound-track, Shang-Chi is one of Marvel's most unexpected gems. It is amazing to feel and denote the love with which these films are made and the fidelity to the source materials. For example, the main character's leitmotif is a work of art and a composition that immerses us even more in the plot. Kevin Feige deserves all the praise, he is truly a man who knows how to sell his product very well and, at the same time, sell us something with great qualitative value.

After the post-credits scenes, fans only crave more and rejoice in the near future for what remains of this phase. Now with the recent release of the trailer for the new Spiderman movie, one only has to cross out the days for its premiere and admire the attention to detail that they put into the making of the films, not only as individual creations, but as a large adjoining and a special set of films. Bravo Marvel.

TLMitch,8,Awesome Movie,"I really enjoyed this movie. My son and I went to see it Saturday of opening weekend, and I am so glad we did. The cinematography and choreography create a visually stunning movie, with a lot of Wuxia mixed in for scenes involving the mother and her people (thing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), with some more traditional MCU fighting in others (the bus scene and the fight outside the skyscraper!). Simu Liu is adorable and wonderful, and although I am not a fan of Akwafina I will say she did a good job in this role, and Michelle Yeoh is always beautiful and engaging in everything she does. However, for me, Tony Leung was amazing. He conveys so many emotions effortlessly. He is not a remorseless killing machine, he has a purpose, and although misguided, he believe in it. He's also smoking hot so he has that going for him. This movie reminds me of Black Panther, both have strong story lines and are visually arresting, and they don't need the entire MCU to move the plot. I would highly recommend seeing it; you won't ne disappointed.",6 September 2021
devashishism,9,Best ever new character launch movie,"I loved the movie. It's very high on entertainment value and achieves a lot you would expect from a new character.

Firstly, the storyline wasn't great but neither common yet it was sufficient to establish all the characters. And then hand to hand combat sequences were beautifully choreographed in 3 totally different settings - bus, macau, and at chinese wakanda. Great to see that almost 60% of movie time was filled with action sequences and remaining also was mostly action related drama. Background score, set design, and overall theme felt fresh.

I rate it high because comparatively previous marvel launch movies were not that great, but definitely this one also lacks on few aspects:

It finally bumped Iron Man down to #2 on my MCU list.",6 September 2021
ryanwesthamfan,8,Another Good Edition To The MCU,"The Good- This film blends all of it's genres in very nicely. It is one part martial arts. One part family drama and one part fantasy. One of the things the MCU is good at is telling stories from different genres and making them fit within the universe and this film does exactly that. This has some of the best fight sequences within the MCU. The dynamic between Shang Chi and Awkwafina's character has a very nice dynamic between the two and really play of each other. All of the characters play a part into the story and none of them really feel pushed to the side. The Villain is also one of the better ones we have in the MCU as he has these conflicting values and we see both his good and bad side. It also isn't very predictable to see what he is going to do next. Finally the director feels like they were given a lot more freedom than usual inside MCU films because of how the story is told there hasn't been many films that have been told in this sort of style or tackling these sort of issues. This movie feels like a significant film into the MCU and moving forward in the MCU which was one of my issues with 'Black Widow'. Overall it delivered everything you want from an MCU film plus some new stuff which I enjoyed.

The Mixed- The humour made me laugh and I found some of it funny. But there is a lot of forced MCU humour. If you are one of them people who are tired from the quick one liners we have in the MCU then this movie is going to frustrate you.

The Bad- One of the biggest problems is the MCU template in the sense that it has to have all these jokes, a massive CGI battle at the end and has to tie into the MCU in different ways. Some of the humour works in the moment but others just fell so forced.

Overall Thoughts- Overall 'Shang Chi' is a exciting mix of the MCU, martial arts, family genre and fantasy. I loved the martial arts aspect but you can tell the MCU formula trying to cheapen the experience a little bit. However put it all together you get yet another MCU film that knows what's coming next. Yet not quite a top teir MCU movie. Overall I'm going to give Shang Chi a 8/10.",6 September 2021

It has the marvel solo hero movie formula with marvel regular comedy which was a good hit in some points and disastrous in others. The background music is fantastic. A mix between modern and classic Chinese melodies. The acting was between ok and very good. The worst thing about this movie is the cgi especially at the last third of the movie.

mackcrocker,9,My thoughts,My thoughts on Shang-Chi are that this was a really good movie and it is actually one of the better Marvel movies. I really enjoyed this movie. The fight choreography was really great and it almost reminded me of crouching tiger in some scenes. It also gave me some Jackie Chan movie vibes in some parts like the way Shang chi fought. It really connected to the marvel universe really well I thought and it also expands it as well. The acting was top notch all around. I thought I was going to hate awkwafina but she actually did a great job she was really funny and she could get emotional in some scenes. A lot of the comedy landed but there was some minor jokes that weren't funny but I got passed those and the other jokes made up for it.the Mandarin was a really intimidating figure. I really thought he could destroy anyone. The big fight scene at the end was really awesome and it's a huge spectacle that had me on the edge of my seat. I loved how they implemented the Asian culture into the films plot. It also ties in some threads from pass movies that really made me glad to finally have answers for. The cgi was amazing and it was very awe inspiring to watch. This was way better than the last marvel movie and I really want to see more of Shang-chi in the future. I give Shang-chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings a 9/10.,3 September 2021
Sjr-lane,7,Middle-of-the-pack MCU film.,"There's a lot to love about Shang-Chi. There's also a lot to grimace about. Both feelings lurk beneath the surface and draw awareness to themselves at various times, creating a wishy-washy overall impact.

Where I'm critical? There's a bit of a haphazard pace to this film. Many scenes contain plot points and/or action sequences that are unbalanced in terms of what is glossed over and what is overly drawn out. There were serious opportunities to do some world building with the new ingredients provided by the vigorously refreshing Asian cultural influence, but it felt like director Destin Daniel Cretton was often going through the motions, checking boxes like he was playing Marvel bingo. The climax, while visually appealing, was predictable from moment to moment and really did not have me on the edge of my seat. Tony Chiu-Wai Leung's villain also didn't quite stick the landing with me, though I've read that his character has really resonated with Asian audience members so I'll humbly accept that maybe his motives lay just a bit outside of my perspective. There were also several ""oh, okay, sure"" moments, lets call them, but a least the writers had the modesty to poke fun at themselves (see: Katy's awe at her own random overnight mastery of a certain skill later in the film).

What I really enjoyed? The cast and characters, first of all. Marvel almost always gets this right. Awkwafina's charisma is palpable. Her character, Katy, never gets in the way of Shang-Chi's natural progression and is genuinely interesting in her own right. I also appreciate the writers' restraint in not simply using her as something to be exploited by the villains to distract/misdirect Shang-Chi. Meng'er Zhang is also a revelation as Xialing, Shang-Chi's scorned, steely sister. Although, a bit more clarity on what her characters' ultimate goals are would have gone a long way as her post-credits appearance left me a bit confused as to where she stands in the greater story. In regards to Simu Liu, I personally felt like he got a bit hoodwinked by the writers who really didn't give Shang-Chi a strong personality other than kicking butt. Regardless, I totally praise his performance and find him endearing to no end. I have faith that he'll really shine when he's plopped into the dynamic of the Avengers. As an aside, just wanted to give an obligatory shoutout to the visual effects and concept designs of the mythical creatures and surreal locations in the film. They really nailed it.

To that end, a completely worthy addition to the MCU that sometimes feels like it's only purpose was to introduce us to the new toy in the Marvel universe that is ""the ten rings"" themselves.",3 September 2021

Also didn't know about the character before and the novelty didn't disappoint as instantly become one of the best heroes origin film both DC and Marvel of course.

marcusman48,3,Effectively nothing new,"SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS is being called ""the Asian BLACK PANTHER,"" and I think this is an inaccurate description for two reasons. First, Asian cultures have been explored in-depth by Hollywood since the 1970s at the latest, and in ways that sub-Saharan African cultures have not. But second, and more to the point, SHANG-CHI is really just a mashup of two Hollywood subgenres that have been around for quite some time: the ""ethnic discovery"" film and the ""stupid American tourist"" film.

The ""ethnic discovery"" film is the more recent type and by far the more interesting, ultimately inspired by Alex Haley's famous TV miniseries ""Roots."" It documents the saga of a protagonist who learns - or relearns - about his or her heritage and embarks on a quest to fully embrace that heritage. A good example I can think of is THUNDERHEART, in which an FBI agent (Val Kilmer) comes to appreciate his father's Native American ancestry while on a case on a Lakota reservation; a more famous but fantasy-based example is STAR WARS, in which Luke Skywalker learns that he has Jedi blood. On the surface, SHANG-CHI definitely follows this pattern.

Unfortunately, the movie's ""ethnic discovery"" theme is undercut by the clich√©s of an even older Hollywood storyline: what one film historian has dubbed the ""racial adventure film,"" but which I simply call the ""stupid American tourist film."" Common since the 1930s, this film plot follows Western (and almost always white) characters as they visit an ""exotic"" foreign land - often for purely exploitative purposes - and proceed to reveal their ignorance about the ""native"" culture. It has always been demeaning to both the ""colonizing"" and indigenous peoples, since the former are forced to make buffoons of themselves and the latter must bear the humiliation of not being taken seriously.

SHANG-CHI is an ""ethnic rediscovery"" film in that two Chinese-Americans from San Francisco learn (and, in one case, relearn) about the culture of their ancestors; but it is also a racial adventure film in that they are essentially Westerners who travel to China and find themselves in the midst of a culture clash. While not white - and, in the case of the titular character, an immigrant - Shang-Chi and his girlfriend otherwise fit the role of the ""stupid American tourist"" with their unmistakably American accents, annoying use of slang, pointless pop-culture references, and wisecracking sarcasm. The twist here is that, like Kilmer in THUNDERHEART, they revert to their ""noble savage"" origins once they have traveled to an ""ethnic"" place and ""gone native.""

Not incidentally, there's one more way in which SHANG-CHI AND THE LEGEND OF THE TEN RINGS differs dramatically from BLACK PANTHER. While both are based on ""non-Western"" comic book sagas created by white men, BLACK PANTHER turns stereotypes about black Africans completely inside-out, giving us fantastic science fiction instead of hackneyed ""jungle"" adventure. But SHANG-CHI is just the usual ""kung pow"" hash about the Orient, presented ironically but also in a way that isn't terribly original.

In fact, if there's another Marvel movie this one closely resembles, it's not BLACK PANTHER but DEADPOOL. Both combine wacky humor and serious (and even ""dark"") subject matter in a way that's very jarring and ultimately exasperating. But at least DEADPOOL felt fresh.",23 September 2021

ethanbresnett,8,A wonderful addition to the MCU!,"Shang-Chi is one of those Marvel films that feels like the full package. It has lots of brilliant trademark MCU humour and tongue in cheek quips. It has exceptional action which I'll get into a bit more. It also has solid connections to the rest of the MCU, balanced well between being its own stand alone film but laying hints of how this is going to fit into the wider story of Phase 4.

I'll start with the action as this is what Shang-Chi is famed for. Quite simply it's awesome. It has the best hand to hand combat the MCU has seen, and sequences that are steeped in Chinese culture, with the rhythmic style of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon woven into the fabric of this film.

The cast was brilliant. Simu Liu was a fantastic lead, and I'd be happy to see him grow into a big player in the MCU. Awkwafina as expected was fantastic, adding so much effortless humour to the film.

What I really love about Shang-Chi is that it has a very well explored and interesting antagonist. This can't always be said for Marvel films as there have been a few phoned in villains, but Shang-Chi doesn't come close to falling into this trap. Tony Leung really sold his role and gave it a lot of power and emotion.

In terms of plot they did a fantastic job of introducing us to this pretty obscure character. There is a lot of exposition and plenty of flashbacks, perhaps too many but I appreciate they had a lot of background content to feed us so I can't grumble too much. I loved how the plot was so mystical and magical, very much feeling like an epic adventure.

tonymyles,6,"Fun, but not engaging","You may (or may not) find Shang-Chi to be a fun movie to see in theaters. The film is full of tropes, from the narration over an origin story, to an inner city urban flip on an distinctly Asian character, to the CGI we're to assume is real (that never quite does translate as real). This well-intentioned film about discovering who you are doesn't seem to know for sure what it is. For example, there is tie-in to the larger Marvel universe, but almost out of corporate necessity to set up subsequent movies versus narrative need to set up a deeper story inside itself. There's also more profanity than other films, often used as a momentary gag that doesn't advance the plot. Even the final sequences land in dark places that confuse the family storyline versus clarify it.

Gpanther67,5,A Middle-of-the-road film that should have been better,"Marvel's newest solo film that introduces an iconic hero from thier vast collection of heroes is certainly for the newer fans that didn't grow up with ""The Master of Kung-Fu"". Even Stan Lee (who was in charge of the company but didn't create Shang-Chi) has admitted he was a comic rip-off of Bruce Lee in looks and style. Adding a mystical and possible alien influence was in my view a mistake and not true to the character's story. Nor the reimaging of The Mandarin, which I found to be disappointing. Aside from the tired storylines which have become common in these Marvel films, the ending was a little over the top. Aside from these criticisms, I'll give kudos to a good cast and wonderful cinematography. If I ever get a faithful adaption of a Marvel comic I grew up with, I might be shocked.

It gets serious for a long stretch in the third act (where it crams all the character development), but the goofiness of the multiple buttons robs what could have been a decent ending of any impact.

There are so many cool/positive things in this movie, that were just completely washed out by terrible pacing, weird story points (32 year old Simu, playing the world's oldest looking 26 year old), and criminally boring visuals. Seriously, who decides to make a super hero kung fu action flick, in which every fight is in shadow or being panned over/cut away from?

Overall, there is enough fun just watching Simu and Awkwafina to make the movie fine if you're an MCU completionist, otherwise it's a safe skip.

Amthermandes,6,"Decent, but most DEFINITELY overrated. The novelty is wearing thin for Marvel","If you rarely are disappointed with Marvel films, and you consider yourself a big fan of them, then you will most likely enjoy this film. It's certainly better than a few of the last installments (by a small margin), but this film is proof to all others that there really aren't any fresh ideas anymore, and the Marvel antics are getting rather boring.

You have good guy who is lackluster in personality, has some family issues, turns out he's a very important guy in the world, has some impressive abilities which he hones, discovers things about himself, has someone close to him betray him, has to make some big decisions, engages in climactic fight, the end.

These movies are so cookie-cutter, all Marvel is now, is predictable pomp and circumstance with flashy lights and SOME, not many, redeeming qualities. Let's start with those first:

Choreography. There are some slick-nasty moves in most of the fight scenes. Action scenes, and entertaining fights is certainly one thing Marvel rarely disappoints.

Humor. Another typical trait of a Marvel film, you get some good chuckles here and there. However without Awkwafina, this trait would be almost non-existent. And this is coming from someone who usually doesn't care for the smarky humor of the latest generations. But she is rather funny without being TOO annoying and sarcastic.

Special effects and cinematography. Solid work, obviously they didn't downsize their SFX department. But compared to the bar set by previous movies in the Marvel world, it's not all that impressive.

On to the unflattering traits:

Story. WOOF. Predictable through and through, don't expect much of anything here. They could easily have held a writing competition at any average middle school for the students to write a basic action movie script, and the storyline for this film would have probably been the entry from the kid who won 3rd place.

Characters. Aside from a a select few, the characters are as flat as a pancake in a hydraulic press.

The humor and the action. While I mentioned this earlier as a pro, over time, it all got old towards the end. The attempts at humor starting falling short of the goal, and the action became stale.

It's about time to wrap up this dynasty of Marvel movies and move onto something else before it starts to smell like discarded scraps of reused ideas, and accumulate maggots of banality.",23 September 2021

It tries way too hard to appeal to every possible viewer. That is why it achieves nothing. It started well with some really awesome martial arts scenes, but then the story got more and more confusing. There were more holes in the plot than in Swiss cheese. For instance, a 14-year old trained assassin apparently got bullied at school - really?? And WHY was this guy who played a British actor even in the plot? The moment he showed up was the moment I was done with that movie. And then there were the over-the-top magical creatures who probably were supposed to get some ""awwws"" from the female audience. But the most disappointing thing to me was, that the more interesting and more badass sister got treated the way women typically get treated in Hollywood: she got totally ignored. Why did the male hero get all the rings? She did deserve at least half of them. It's male storytelling at its finest. As usual.",28 September 2021

The Film is great if any of you are a fan of Martial Arts you are going to enjoy this also really dives into the spirituality of eastern mythos of the MCU while still have ties to the MCU Wenwu was responsible for the Ten Rings in the Iron Man films going back to the very beginning also love the father dynamic between Shang and The Mandarin great performances from Liu and Leung as well also Awkwafina continues to be on a role since Breaking out in Crazy Rich Asians and also starring in similar film in Raya And The Last Dragon This Is a Game changer also if your A Fan Forbidden Kingdom your are going love this ,This is Game Changer much like Doctor Strange in 2016.

If you've seen one of these movies recently you have an idea of what you're in for. If you're into that you'll enjoy it, if you're burnt out on movies feeling the same and characters sounding the same and acting the same and being very the same it will be just another Disney movie in 2021 to kill 2 hours with and get nothing out of.

I've been watching Chinese action stars since I was a child. I'm aware of the main actors comments about not being aware of Chinese heroes before himself somehow because he's done zero research and doesn't enjoy classic cinema in his own time.... and is a 2021 person and wants to just say things, virtue signaling I believe it's called.. but I'd recommend he check some of those movies out instead as they're much more interesting.",9 September 2021

Unfortunately, the second half isn't as tight, the story becomes a little too fantastical ending in a god awful CGI mess that has become all too common with the MCU bringing the score down.

I did however, on the whole really enjoy this but I did think that it was more about the whole cast rather than an origin story of Shang-Chi because an awful lot of attention seems to be given his sister and his friend Katy which seemed odd to me?

But sort of odd in a good way because they managed to flesh the characters out enough to make them seem like 'characters' rather than expendable supporting cast.

The first third of the movie was for me, the strongest and seeing the full fight scene on the bus shown in the trailer made me appreciate the choreography that went into this. The final third was fine... I wasn't bored... The middle though? Nah :(

I preferred this to Black Widow because it's part of the new phase and not some remnant carry over and just felt fresh!

However, this film felt less like a marvel film and more of a Disney film (Less so in the beginning of the film but towards the end I felt like I was watching a fantasy film). The whole final fight scene just felt so Disney and in all honesty it bumped my opinion a lot which was disappointing because I enjoyed the beginning so much.

b_trought,6,My girlfriend loved it. I was a little underwhelmed,"To start, Shang Chi is a film worth going to see. If you're a Marvel fan it'll be a film that you'll enjoy; story, links to the wider MCU, action, comedy, and visuals. Just take a look at the reviews on here and you get the idea that it's a v good MCU film, that is slightly different from others that we've seen.

I thought to add a few things not mentioned in the reviews on here that struck me while I was watching; a. The slow motion and music/sound during the slow Mo. Something I've noticed about Chinese cinema over the past 2 decades is the over use of slow Mo to try and be poignant or emotional. It's been overdone, especially with the slightly cheesey background music to labour the point. ShangChi leans heavily on these several times and I found myself rolling my eyes more than once. Admittedly you may not notice it.

B. The CGI. I thought it wasn't great, particularly at the start in the forest fight and the bus scene. It got better though, and overall the climactic fight was well rendered, if a little disorientating.

C. The 'eastern' mystical stuff. They tried to shoehorn in a couple of things but honestly it's kinda like an impression that a westerner would have about 'Eastern history and culture'. It reminded me a little bit of what Marvel did with The Ancient One (a Caucasian lady in Asian clothes), and the way Danny Rand tried to spout a few mystical phrases in Iron Fist.

D. Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh and Yuen Wah. Three major players in Chinese cinema going all the way back to the 80s (I think)... It was great to see them here, particularly Tony Leung who has some of the most expressive eyes in film (I know it's a weird thing to say, but he has) and Yuen Wah who was a classmate of Jackie Chan. I would have liked to have seen more of the latter to be honest and would recommend you check him, Jackie, Sammo Hung and Yuan Biao out on YouTube.

E. The fight scenes. Overall they were very good, particularly the hand to hand on the bus (before the CGI). That one was sharp, aggressive and brilliantly choreographed. The one in the forest though!!! It's was one of that have been overdone in Chinese cinema, so an eye roller for me... ie a relationship developing as a result of a fight.

F. The humour was great imo and the delivery was great overall.

Like I said above it's worth seeing and you'll probably enjoy it. My girlfriend (who's not watch a whole lot of Asian cinema) did. I've seen a fair share of it, from the Shaw Brothers films up to modern day, so somethings did grate on me. Did I enjoy it though? Overall, yes.",3 September 2021

Perhaps we are all vaccinated against Marvel's all over the place magic to a point that everything looks familiar, boring and flat. Or perhaps the film is just not that great.

My big problem with this film is the bus sequence at the start. It eeps going downhill. I mean.. if you can make turns with the bus, why does it keep going down all the time?

jenkinscammy,5,The worst offering in the MCU,"This movie makes Black Widow look like an Oscar winning screenplay.

The story is just SOOOO bad. There's way too much raw exposition about past events. It feels like half the movie is spent recounting the past in stale narrative exposition. When this much backstory is needed, then you're trying to pack too much into a single film.

Character motivations are unclear. Shang Chi's behavior is inexplicable at times, and his sidekick's behavior is similarly confusing. The movie opens with the two of them in low paying jobs, yet somehow they are jet-set world travelers at the drop of a hat. Shang continually puts his friend in life-threatening danger.

The movie is weakened by fan service. The callback to Iron Man 3 makes zero sense. Casting Ben Kingsley for comedic relief does nothing for the story.

This movie all but breaks the MCU's continuity and overarching story. It introduces new dimensions, races and powers without regard for existing storylines.

Cameos don't help. Kingsley's Trevor Slattery feels about 10 years too late and most of his previous story arc from ""Iron Man 3"" and ""Hail to the King"" is negated and/or ignored. Wong is used as comic relief, but doesn't help much more than that.

There's nothing fresh in this movie, just Disney trying to cash in on an inferior product.",4 September 2021

I felt like it was a little long and also I didn't feel like it was connected to the MCU. I supposed it'll all come together at some point because as we know Marvel never misses a beat. My biggest criticism was the acting, especially from Awkwafina. Her acting is awful. Overacting throughout the entire movie. I didn't find her funny at all, although she was placed in the movie as comic relief. Totally flopped.

The other thing that forces the score down for me is Bri Larson's insignificant cameo (she just is not good for her role and has zero charisma! And the forced ""Girl Power"" moments.

binaratmaja,10,"Martial Arts, Disney, Raya and The Dragon,Powerfull father that die in 10 seconds","Shang-chi review : spectacular visual wonder My rating : 8.5/10 Cast & performances : The film has Simu Liu in top form. He is your ordinary guy but extraordinary powers and actor blends into the character well - with not a single false note. Giving him good company are actresses Awkwafina who is effortless in whatever she does and Meng'er Zhang who also performs some mind-numbing stunts.

The star of the film of course is veteran actor Tony Leung- a father who wants to bring back his family together but also is aware of his extraordinary powers. It's his love for his dead wife that makes him tough and cold towards his children. Years back Leung had charmed the world with his subtle style in Wong Kar Wai's 'In The Mood For Love'. Decades later, Leung has aged like fine wine and it's a delight to watch him play the antagonist with such style.

Ben Kingsley and Michelle Yeoh too make their presence felt in the limited screen time they have.

Technical values : Shang-Chi scores high on its technical front. Each and every craft excels in giving a thoroughly enjoyable superhero action flick. The top-class VFX take the audience into a world of mythical adventure. The cinematography, production design and background score are top-notch.

Shang-Chi, directed by Destin Daniel Cretton, attempts to shake up the Marvel formula by infusing it with martial-arts action and fairy-tale fantasy and grounding it in Chinese and Asian American culture. And while its disparate elements don't meld together as smoothly as they should, they do, in the end, add up to a superhero movie fresh and fun enough to feel worth a spin"".

Shang Chi's strength lies in balancing itself. For every high octane action sequence, there's a back story to get you readjusted to your seat. The amazingly choreographed fights will bring you to the edge of your seats and at the same time, you can't help but groove to the peppy background score. There are so many good songs on their list.

Apart from music, Marvel once again excels in terms of CGI. The graphics are so compelling that you don't regret stepping inside a cinema hall in times of a pandemic. They're worth it.

Highlights : Cast & Brilliant performances Stunning top notch visual effects Extraordinary High Octane Action Stunts Fantastic Cinematography Terrific Background Score Good story and Direction

Overall : Adventurous ride into a mythical world.",23 September 2021

Movie doesn't rely heavily on jokes which is a big relief cause marvel movies nowadays rely too much on jokes they stuff joked in emotional scenes too. Like they played Thor's depression for jokes, Thor meeting his dead mother after a long time was also foreshadowed by jokes. Jokes occupy most of newer marvel movies even endgame falls victim to this. But this movie is different there are joked but they are placed well. Characters won't joke between fights or between emotional heavy hitting scenes and boy the action in this movie its captivating to say the least. The dynamic between Shang chi and his father is awesome. You sympathize with both Shang chi and his father. Marvel feels like old school marvel this time.

masonfisk,6,COULD'VE BEEN BETTER...!,"The current MCU effort is truly a slight one as it swings for the fences to do what Black Panther did for all inclusive audiences by presenting an African superhero now we have a candidate, of the Asian persuasion, hoping for a repeat. Filling in the backstory of the rings (first introduced way back in the first Iron Man) which star Tony Leung has wielded for about 1000 years, which are a means of gaining power but when Leung wants to conquer a revered village in a remote forest, he meets his match & love which quells his desire to dominate fathering a pair of offspring (a boy & girl) as icing on the cake. Years later we find the scion, now played Simu Liu, living in the States working as a valet attendant w/his best friend, played by Awkwafina. When on a bus ride some men accost Lung for his jade pendant, his fighting prowess presents itself & fearing his sister is in similar straits (a cryptic postcard he received from her makes him think so), off he goes back to the bosom of Leung's fortress where he reveals their long dead mother may still be alive being held captive by the same residents of the Shangri-La he wanted to subjugate years before setting up a massive battle between Leung's forces & benevolent group of villagers who know the voice of Leung's wife is actually a captive dragon trickster hoping to be unleashed in order to feed on the souls of the nearby populace. So far so good, right? Wrong. Why did the usual craft & polish Disney's output come up short here? Lackluster lead, check, hackneyed story w/vague intimations of Asian legends & so forth, check (they do realize this comic book character was created by a couple of white guys!) & a third act replete w/motion & color to entice the viewers into thinking something more important is going on when the truth is, it isn't, check again. Didn't Disney fail to realize this was to be their third Asian inflected release in a year (after the live action Mulan remake & Raya & the Last Dragon animated feature, which also featured Awkwafina's vocal talents) so some of the story-lines would begin to cross pollinate & dilute each other until the final result would look like so much of a hodgepodge? I hate to be the dissenting opinion here but I would've rather have seen a big screen treatment of Iron Fist over this, apologies. Also starring Benedict Wong reprising his Wong character, Yuen Wah from Kung Fu Hustle as an archery elder, Michelle Yeoh as Liu's aunt & Zach Cherry (in his second incarnation in the MCU, he played the hot dog vendor who dares Spider-man to flip in Homecoming) here playing a bus passenger.",13 September 2021

Technically this is a massive achivment but sadly the story does not hold up. As the movie goes on the story gets weaker and weaker until it becomes a giant cgi fest like every other superhero movie ever. There is obviously a lot of heart and talent that went into this project but the mcu is turning 13 years old now and we are still using this same repetitive formula.

The choice of character, do they truly represent China or other Asian culture? If a Chinese or other Asian watches this, would they like them just like Americans and Europeans would feel for the character of Iron man or Thor?

The Mandarin talk sounds very strange for people who really speak and understand Chinese.

I can see it is trying to put in some Asian, or at least Chinese bits in, like the water map, the bamboo...... but it is still unable to achieve what we might think is beautiful, but for Westerns, it's fine to show as this is Asian style.",10 September 2021

The first part of the movie is pretty good, the second half all the way to the end is pretty ridiculous. I won't give away anything here. My wife is Asian, so I went with her family to see it last night. It was all Asians in the theatre besides a few white people. I asked my sister-in-law why she liked it so much, and her reason was ""because I'm Asian."" That's exactly how Obama became President, and why black panther did well at the box office, because minorities support minorities whether the finished product is good or not. It's rather annoying, and I don't care who gets offended reading this, because it's fact! All the big babies will down vote this, but they know I'm right.

The two main leads are compelling, I loved the comedic timing of Awkwafina and the seamless choreography of the movie, everything flowed easily, and the color palette and cinematography are also compelling arguments here. My favorite scene is a harmonious ""dance"" between two characters that grabbed me to the screen and didn't let go.

Overall, if you enjoy Chinese mythology mixed in with the familiarity of the MCU then you are sure to enjoy this origin story, the best one since 'Black Panther', for me at least. It got me hyped about what is coming!

ag-62033,9,One of Marvel's best origin story.,"Shang-Chi is visually spectacular and combats well with the fight choreography, which is the strongest part about the movie. As Marvel's first Asian led superhero movie, it amazingly depicts the story of a young man trying to become someone who is completely different than his father and fits well with the movie's heritage of the mandarin. The introduction of the ten rings bring a bold new perspective of the weapon from the comics and becomes one of the best powers to have in the MCU.

katimcbride,10,Beautiful Film - just as many laughs as there were tears,"I found this story to be incredibly moving and I absolutely loved the story. My partner and I spent the entire ride home comparing notes and gushing about the acting. Anyone who says ""the acting is ok"" is using that BS to support their overall dislike for the film *or* they've recently changed their meds. I was surprised at how well Awkwafina's character fit into it all. She was an anchor for the main character to the life he ran away to. She had purpose - especially in the end.

They all had great character development and I loved the story. The antagonist killed it and he just layers upon layers. The main characters acting was outstanding.

I cried through a lot of this film. At several points I asked myself why the hell I was crying so much (wait... did I recently change meds?!). Maybe it's the family loss that hit home. They brought in other characters from the MCU and it was nice seeing so many other movies threaded into this.

cwkenreich,8,"Not original, but still nicely executed","Let's face it, Shang-chi is pretty much Black Panther with an all Asian cast. I'm sure this sounds rather cynical but here me out: the first half of the film is a down-to-earth James Bond kind of film, then our protagonist reunited with his family halfway through and is transported to a fantasy world, only to have internal family conflicts drive the rest of the plot. Sound familiar? I'm in no way saying the two are parallels but this overarching story arc is becoming cliche. Black Widow was sort of guilty of this in a way, but was still unique in its own right, for better or for worse. In the case of Shang-Chi, the plot was extremely predictable. He would inevitably reunite with his family and battle his father. That didn't strip the film of all suspense, but Marvel screenwriting remains an Achilles heal.

Wew! Now that I've got that out of the way, here's everything I loved about this movie: this has the GREATEST fight choreography of any Marvel movie Ever. There was this beautiful, majestic rhythm and flow to every single action scene that at many parts gave me literal goosebumps. For once, the CGI complimented the action beautifully without making me cringe. In a way it was like a remake of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In addition, the acting was above average for a Marvel movie. The complex motivations of the hero and villain were realistically portrayed. Speaking of the villain, Xu Wenwu deserves a spot next to Thanos and Killmonger as one of Marvel's greatest antagonists. And compare to the snooze-fest that was Black Widow, the plot was flying as fast as a dragon. Finally, the cherry on top, Awkwafina and the hilarious comic-relief she infused into this whole story. Her style was really reminiscent of Guardians of the Galaxy. The film wouldn't have been nearly as entertaining without her.

Overall, this definitely exceeded expectations (although they were pretty low after Black Widow). It's a pleasing popcorn movie with enough complexity and artistry to garner some awards. And for Marvel fans, it's clear Shang-Chi's existence in this universe is a game changer.",19 September 2021

Producers added Ben Kingsley and Benedict Wong to tailor Shang-Chi to other MCU movies, but it feels so disconnected like Billy Bob Thornton as a Santa in Bad Santa. Michelle Yeoh is playing Crouching Tiger again, it's so SAD that Hollywood does not give her non-kung-fu roles, she has talent for sure.

looking_Work,7,Enjoyable But Forgettable,"Having been starved for a Marvel movie and after the fiasco that was Black Widow, I think many are rating this movie higher than it deserves.

A running time of 2hr and 13 min felt more like 2 and a half hrs. Awkwafina, meant to be the comedic sidekick, was completely out of place. She had no skill set, could not speak Chinese and was not particularly funny. I did not like the pacing particularly the numerous flashbacks to the past. Instead of attempting to subvert our expectations by springing surprises on the audience as it relates to a character's character it would have worked better to have a linear timeline. Doc Ock was not shown to be evil out of the box and then through flashbacks is it explained why he is the way he is.

Finally, I felt that cinematically you can see similarities between this movie and other martial arts movies released in the early 2000s (Hero, The Forbidden Kingdom) specifically in some fight scenes.",4 September 2021

beanjaminmote,3,this movie sucks,"This movie was very disappointing. It was very poorly made and did not seem to be thought out at all. Which is why I was bewildered to find that this movie was so widely liked by the mcu fanbase, and was saddened to find even some of my friends liked the movie. I've seen this film be praised for its good characters, humor, fight scenes and storytelling. But I strongly disagree with almost all praise for this movie. I will admit there are some things to praise this movie for but whatever they are they are few and far between.

This movie had some decent choreography for the fights, about a third of the fights were pleasing to the eye. However I only enjoyed 2 fights and that is only because the lead actor Simu Liu was the main focus of the fights. With Simu Liu background in martial arts he was able to do the fight choreography without the movie resorting to the overly zoomy and shaky camera with 5 cuts per movement that plagues most of the other mc movies. But sadly the rest of the fights are the typical marvel cutty fights or a gross mush of group fights with no discernible stakes.

The main character actually had some good moments where I felt like he was a good person and he actually did not cause casualties in the double digits unlike most of the other recent ""heroes"". But he has no personality and all of his decisions make little sense. The bad guy has many of the same problems where they establish his character but then they make him do things against that character. Sadly there were no other characters that could carry them due to the fact that most of the characters in the movie were either soulless things with useless unfunny jokes or characters with exposition to shove down our throats, and only made decisions to move the plot onwards. This saddened me greatly because I rather like a lot of the actors in this movie.

There were 2-3 jokes in the whole movie that I found even remotely funny. Besides those all the jokes were bad and lazy, usually ruining the mood of the scene or just carrying on for far too long. But due to the large amount of jokes and the little amount of comedic relief all of the ""funny"" characters seemed tasteless, unfunny and annoying.

The story told was not inherently bad, It just had to rely on the hollow dialog to carry it along. And with most of the characters not really being expanded upon they seem to only be vesicles for this bad move to work.in all i did not enjoy watching this movie, i did however enjoy bashing on it with my friends and making fun of my ex-friends for liking it.",27 September 2021
themctier,3,PUT MY HUSBAND AND ME TO SLEEP,"First of all, my husband and I love superhero and sci-fi movies. We have seen most, if not all, of them either at home or on the big screen. We love the action, suspense, and thrills most of the movies provide. While this movie was visually appealing, it lacked the momentum that my husband and I are accustomed to from the MCU. Both of us fell asleep during the movie when things became so boring that we couldn't hold our eyes open. Towards the end, when they introduced the ""comedy relief,"" both my husband and I groaned. This movie did not need comedy relief; it needed action and suspense--neither of which appeared until the last 15 minutes of the movie.

The mother and the sister were the strongest characters, yet the mother had to give up her powers when she married this horrible man and the daughter - despite being overlooked all her life mustered up the strength and motivation to become a great fighter. Although she was way stronger than her brother, she ended up with nothing, while her brother is now the master of the rings.

Bigg_Bad,6,Decent but kind of meh,"The movie as a whole is a decent watch. It has some great ideas and fight scenes, but it all just seems a little shallow, and like the movie is scare of commit to anything so it just ends up falling like none of the great potential ever amounts to any thing.

The actor who portrays Shang Chi does a good job, but he unfortunately does not get much depth to work with, he starts and ends his character ark at basically the same spot, he does not really get any moments to express any real emotion.

For me there are 3 main problems.

1. The sister character is only there to show a female character can be a badass...""we know, don't cram it down our throats"" it makes it feel forced, and takes away the impact of the character. But the main problem of focusing so much on her is that the main character in the story never really gets enough time to develop a character.

2. The Mandarin, never feels really intimidating og loving, they try to be so middle of the road on everything with this character, that he neither feels believeable as any of those opposites or as ""real person"" in general. A shame because I don't think the actor is to blame, it is simply poor writing and directing.

3. Shang Chi, doesn't feel like he has much impact on the story, especially in the second half, where the is more focus on secondary roles than him. And his impact on the final battle is minimal at best. The first half of the movie is clearly the stongest, and goes kinda downhill from there.

There is one special cameo though, that is sure to delight and give some laughs.

theredsky,6,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings Review,"This is yet another film that I appreciate more than I actually like it. I'm really glad this movie exists and we have more diverse characters in the MCU. The Film nails Shang-Chi. Simu Liu gives a great performance and while his motivation isn't exactly clear, his character is and I like that. It's good to see that the origin movie does a great job at giving us a somewhat compelling character that I am looking forward to seeing more of. However, all of the other characters aren't anywhere close to being as good. The performances from most everyone is good with Tony Leung giving a great performance. His villain isn't great character wise but what I really adored was his villain's motivation. We finally get a true villain who is motivated by grief and the inability to accept the loss of a loved one. I love that about him and it's refreshing to see that. The story here is very weak. I didn't engage with it that much and it was hard to understand the motivations of anyone except the villain. The plot progresses quickly but it's hard to remember individual story beats because it kinda melds into some of the other MCU films. One thing that does stand out are the visuals and some of the action sequences. Some of the action sequences here were great like the final battle while others felt lackluster. It's a mixed bag in regards to that. As always, the visuals for this film are great for the most part. There is the occasional weird visual effect but it doesn't get absolutely horrible. The production design was surprisingly great here. All of the sets look really cool and it's obvious they spent a lot of time on that. There really isn't a lot more to say. On one hand, there are a lot if great things here but in the other, it feels like a standard Marvel movie. I would recommend checking it out if you are still into the MCU.",29 September 2021
carltonk6,6,Don't really understand the hype to be honest,"Don't get me wrong, from a visual and colourfully fantastical point of view, this film was amazing.

But for an MCU film, which we have all come to love for being so intricate and detailed, this film falls flat for me. It just doesn't make any sense with the universe that the MCU has built up to this point.

Certain rules and historic lore has been completely discarded. And I think the villain of this movie is one of the worst and least relatable of the entire franchise. It just made no sense. And even during the climactic ""battle"" things were happening that just weren't explained. We just kind of had to accept what we were seeing as possible without understanding what was happening.

And unfortunately the character depth of most of the cast in this film was very poor. Certain characters were sort of just there for the sake of it. With no real purpose or direction, and they were some of the closest characters to the main guy!

I don't often say this - infanct I've only said it once before when leaving the cinema after a marvel film, I feel disappointed, confused and left thinking ""they could've done it better""",28 September 2021

I still wanted to see it because, well, Marvel movies are just fine and I believed it would be good. And it was. It was. The story, in my opinion, wasn't as good as it usually is with Marvel. Not that Marvel has any masterful storylines, but it just wasn't as good in my opinion as some of the other movies that have come out from the studio in the past. What was more than good, on the other hand, was the music in places. But what was without a doubt the best and what Marvel has always been able to do and probably always will be able to do is action. The action scenes here are awesome, although then they are not very frequent. There are a few times when the pace slows down and we wait for some of the fights. Once it does though, you're in for an epic CGI load of fighting that I devoured. There's still the occasional quirk thrown in here and there, as is usually the case with Marvel movies. To sum it up.

The story is good, though it does too often rely on the standard Marvel plot points that are in almost all of these movies. But the film is truly lifted up by its incredible action. This is hands down the best action in the MCU, and after seeing Black Widow, which was terrible, cutting every half second during fights, this film utilizing wide shots and long takes was a breath of fresh air. There's a lot to love here and if it wasn't for some of the odd choices and the humor, which was about 50/50 hit or miss for me, then this would be a 10 star film.

bob-the-movie-man,9,Ten Rings to rule them all...,"Positives:
This is Marvel at its best. A script (with Shakespearean undertones) that melds action with good character development and laugh-out-loud feelgood dialogue. The great thing is that you don't need to be a Marvel nerd to enjoy this one. Yes, there are some fabulous Easter Eggs for Marvel fans (and a wonderful return of a character from one of the early films). But its almost a standalone feature in its own right.


The action sequences are top-notch, particularly an early fight on a careering an Francisco ""bendy-bus"". Some great martial arts reminiscent of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", made more exciting by the fact that the impressive Simu Liu did all his own stunts.






Negatives:






Timeline?: So, it took more of a Marvel nerd than I am (my wonderful daughter-in-law Bronwyn) to point out that although this film is set (largely) in the ""Present Day"", the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"" actually happen in 2023. So in the Marvel timeline, this is set in between Thanos's ""blip"" and ""the return"". This is the reason why Wong is present but not Doctor Strange, for example.

Summary Thoughts: Marvel goes East! This is a really entertaining addition to the franchise, mixing Marvel action with Eastern mysticism and martial arts. It's an impressive job by director and co-writer Destin Daniel Cretton, in only his second feature (he did ""Just Mercy"" in 2019).

As a Marvel film, there are of course end-credit scenes (""monkeys"" in onemannsmovies speak). A mid-title one is the best, bringing some additional Marvel characters into the mix. And there's a post-credits one which sets up for further sequels but which I found rather irritating.

It's ironic that a Marvel movie so right for the Chinese market - the first to be headlined by an Asian actor and with substantial Mandarin dialogue - might not get a release in China. According to this report, this appears to be for two reasons: firstly that the actor Simu Liu made some derogatory remarks about China in the past, and secondly that in the comics Shang Chi's father is Fu Manchu - a Western-derived character with racial overtones.

This doesn't seem to have hurt it so far. After less than two weeks of opening, it has made $262 million on a budget estimated to be $150-200 million.

CinemaSerf,7,Visually spectacular if maybe a little bit flat on the story front.,"Having just enjoyed a series of Wong Kar-wei films, it was great to see the star of many of his classic features - Tony Leung - feature in this superior fantasy adventure. He is the man with the magical and all-powerful ten rings and two estranged children. It is only when his son ""Shaun"" (Simu Liu) has a lively altercation with some heavies on a San Francisco bus that he realises there is impending danger, seeks out his independently minded sister and before you know it, the family are - somewhat unwillingly - reunited and working together to rescue their late, lamented mother from the clutches of an evil being protected by a benign society led by Michelle Yeoh. To be honest, the story isn't the best - it's actually a little bit simple and predictable. That said, however, the characterisations are engaging and the action scenes are well staged and paced. There is an interesting underlying premiss that has to resonate now as the planet appears to be fighting back against mankind's accumulated indifference - the Elysian utopia that ""Xu Wenwu"" (Leung) must invade to rescue his wife being symbolic of the unspoilt elements of the planet that have no intention of rolling over peaceably whilst we impose ourselves on it. The production standards are typically high, with plenty of cute and dangerous beasties to suit and please all ages. There is also quite a fun series of scenes from Sir Ben Kingsley as a Liverpudlian poet (maybe his accent isn't the best!) before a stylishly crafted finale. All told, this is a thoroughly entertaining watch that at over two hours flies by.",15 September 2021

PyroSikTh,8,Phase Four is in Full Swing!,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings far surpassed any expectations I had. It's easily the best Marvel movie post-Infinity Saga (I know, that's not exactly saying much), and is very promising for the quality of Marvel's next projects. We have probably the second best villain intimately tied to the origin of a new, entertaining, and capable hero full of potential, in a story that ties the universe together and teases upcoming events in tantalising and unexpected ways. The fight choreography was on point, the dialogue was seeped in cultural significance, the jokes all land, and the CGI is some of the best since Thanos himself. Shang-Chi is an all-out success for Marvel, it seems in multiple ways - both critically and financially. Really its only downfall is that at times this doesn't feel like that much of a movie about Shang-Chi himself purely because his origin is tied so closely to the story of the Ten Rings. Instead it's a Ten Rings movie featuring Shang-Chi, which is fine, but feels a bit weird for his introduction into the MCU. And yes, the Ten Rings are tied up with the Iron Man films perfectly, almost making the whole Aldrich Killian thing better in retrospect. I give Shang-Chi a high 8/10, with promise of moving up with rewatches.",7 September 2021

On a positive note, the visuals and martial arts are absolutely spectacular. The first act of the film contains most of the martial arts and it is so crisp and well-choreographed. The final act flexes all of the CGI dollas and they make they already big budget stretch far, with some of the more impressive sights you will see in a Marvel movie so far.

mr_sharma,7,Fun 2/3 and then a rather obvious and weak last third,"I enjoyed this more than Black Widow. Black Widow wasn't bad, but when you've had two great Spider-Man's, a fantastic Captain America or two and the amazing Infinity war....well Black Widow just seems meh.

But why are we talking about that when now we have Shang Chi.

To give it's complete title that would also include the legend of the 10 rings.

Overall I enjoyed this but the pity is the weak and predictable ending. The obligatory 2 end credit scenes are also there.

Where it excels is the first 2/3rds. It has a very Spider-Man feel to it in the sense of easy going humour. The fight scenes are great....although some seem simply contrived to show off martial arts being performed in a different to the usual place martial arts films usually have their fights.....but then Jackie Chan films have been doing this stuff decades ago. Still fun though.

There are some neat touches involving referencing characters introduced in other Marvel films which adds a different dimension and pleases some of the fan base.

But ultimately, it all winds up like a million other big budget fighting the monster in the end of film blockbuster. Lots of bangs, exposition, non sensical OTT fight scenes and a little perplexing how we even got here.

It suffers from sugar coated neatness.

After all, this film starts well with some dark tones along the way but ends up being too neat. Like a moral compass advert for how ideally one's life can be redeemed by not being a dick for a few seconds.

Still as popcorn movies go (and boy have we missed them these past two years), this is perfectly serviceable.

Nowhere on par with the two recent spideys. In fact, I'ld say if you can hold out till it gets to Disney+ next month (October 2021), watch it then for nothing more as it's included with your subscription.

I must say, Marvel (Disney) are churning out same ole same ole....nothing new whereas DC are knocking it out the park.....first with the excellently unsettling Joker and the recent The Suicide Squad. With The Batman possibly delivering on it's Riddler promise, we may have a shift back to DC in terms of power balance. This is surprising to me as DC have churned out some proper crud over the years.

They went with the whole family thing, we've seen it a thousands times, but they did a good job at it, was pretty emotional at parts.

Dunkaccino,5,Shang-Chi,"Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is the new installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It stars Simu Liu as his first lead role, slings with Akwafina, Michelle Yeoh, and the great Tony Leung.

Ricky Gervais has said it clearly before: Actors nowadays do adventure fantasy nonsense, their job isn't acting but going to the gym and taking steroids.

Shang-Chi is nothing but an ""adventure fantasy nonsense"". It features some of the most ridiculous scenes in the MCU and some awkward green-screen scenes.

Simu Liu is Shang-Chi, who has a rivalry with his father (Tony Leung). Actors here don't do a bad job, but you don't really feel for the character Shang-Chi.

Tony Leung is a master of acting. It's a shame we dont get more dramatic scenes with him. Awkwafina and Ben Kingsley's characters are the comic relief characters, which, every Marvel movie needs apparently.

I think the acting is pretty decent, the actors do a good job being funny and some of the action scenes are pretty awesome but that's already expected from a MCU production, my real issue with this movie is it's plot, it's a tale about a chinese warrior that doesn't use his abilities for sht even though he was raised to be a fighter and do something but instead he just runs away and hides in new york with this boring comic relief/love interest character, and leaves his sister behind not even caring about it, alright i can buy all that but where's his motivation?

Then suddenly a guy with a sword in his arms appears and steals his necklace and he starts to do something about it, wow what an amazing chinese hero let's give some applause...

Plus his dad/villain is totally forgettable, the whole relationship is poorly written, in one scene he says he's going to kill his dad and in the other he basically forgot about it, the dad doesn't have one scene of development, his character is weak af probably one of the worst antagonists in the MCU, the CGI dragons are pretty amazing but other than that it's just another formula marvel bull and totally forgettable.",7 September 2021

hunter-friesen,6,"""Shang-Chi"" Brings Balance to the MCU","For nearly ten years after its inception, the Marvel Cinematic Universe was dominated by the adventures of white men. Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow had to fight to get her own film this year, while her male co-stars got entire trilogies . ""Black Panther"" reinvigorated the franchise with its celebration of African culture in 2018, proving that the Marvel brand didn't have to be so beige. ""Captain Marvel"" became the first MCU film to be fronted by a woman. Now, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" marks the first Asian-led film. Not only does the film feature the first Asian protagonist, it also features a predominantly Asian cast and crew, which, thankfully, give this franchise a much needed change in perspective.

The Ten Rings have been around for nearly a thousand years, gifting their wearer, Wenwu, immortality so that he may rule with unmatched strength. After centuries of building an empire out of blood, Wenwu was turned away from a life of violence by Ying Li, a guardian of the mystical land of Ta Lo. When heartbreak struck shortly after, Wenwu picked up the rings once again, causing him to go down a dark path, and his son, Shang-Chi, to run away to the United States. Now after ten years, the son must come home to confront his father and become who he was truly meant to be.

Similar to what Ryan Coogler was able to do with ""Black Panther"", co-writer/director Destin Daniel Cretton brings out the best of this new world as he is able to handle the mountains of establishing exposition. His use of flashbacks may be a bit liberal, especially as the film reaches its climax, but they're used meaningfully to build upon a story focused on character and culture.

Without a leading acting credit to his name, Simu Liu takes the titular role by storm as he navigates this typical hero's journey with charm and composure. Mixing a bit of T'Challa with Tony Stark, Shang-Chi is a hero battling with his past and future. Liu and Cretton strike a great balance as Liu hands himself over to Cretton's material in the somber moments, and Cretton lets Liu's comedic instincts light up the room.

Veteran Tony Leung brings the same melancholic energy to Wenwu as he did in his roles with Wong Kar-wai, particularly his work in ""In the Mood for Love."" Leung layers this villain and distances him from the average world dominator. He carries a stillness about him that inspires fear and compassion, two things that have made some of the greatest villains.

The overall narrative within a Marvel film is evenly composed of the plot and the action. Thankfully, Cretton blends both those halves together as he imbues the setpieces with the qualities of the wuxia genre, taking after such films as Ang Lee's ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (also starring Michelle Yeoh) and Zhang Yimou's ""House of Flying Daggers."" The action often tells as much of the story as the dialogue, particularly in the gracefully dazzling opening sequence. But there's also room for brutality as the first act ends with a tower-scaffolding brawl where Shang-Chi's emotions turn him into a raw killer. Not since ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" has the action been so impactful on a technical and emotional level.

When allowed to be its own film, ""Shang-Chi"" is quite the spectacle. But when it gets forcefully molded into a Marvel film, the results are less than stellar. Even after all his work with the story and action, Cretton can't break free from the third-act visual effects extravaganza that holds this franchise like an iron vice. It's a shame as the smaller familial moments do more for the mind and soul than the forgettable litany of explosions that encompass the final thirty minutes. Being that this is the 25th film in the franchise, I've come to expect that level of disappointment.

Thanks to its multi-talented cast and crew, ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" is one of the better origin stories within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The action may (rightfully) be the selling point, but the heart of the film lies within its characters, telling a familiar story on an impressive scale.",10 September 2021

moonracer0120,7,Philosophically something is missing,"Shang-Chi has great special effects and a compelling storyline but the script doesn't get too emotionally deep. This is one of the major liabilities of trying to tell a good story in about 2 hours. You simply can't because it takes time for viewers to develop care, concern, and emotional attachment to characters. So, what is best told in 2 hours? Robust short stories with excellent special effects that can only be enjoyed on the big screen. To this end Shang-Chi delivers in loads. The action is fast and the camera work while a bit dizzying captures the action very well. The only major issue I had with the plot is with the monsters that the heroes are fighting against. If you watch Chinese wuxia or xianxia dramas, you know that stories involving magical beasts are always based on Chinese mythology, Taoism, Buddhist, Chinese folk religion, traditional medicine, etc. Taoist immortals spouting what sounds like gibberish to laypeople is a classic character trope. The evil creatures that Shang-Chi fights against do not fit into the xiaxia genre world view. If they are demons no explanation is given for why they are so demonic? Have they been denounced by a bohisattva? Are they former immortals who failed to cultivate and somehow reincarnated into the hungry ghost realm? It may just be that wuxia and xianxia are so deeply developed (and this is obvious when you watch any popular Chinese historical drama--from ""Eternal Love"" ot ""Legend of Fuyao"") that deivating from these highly developed genres makes the film feel less ""Chinese"". While many elements of Shang-Chi resemble a Chinese fantasy drama the lack of proper wuxia and xianxia elements makes it feel like philosophically something is missing--at least from someone who watches a lot of these dramas on Rakuten Viki!",25 September 2021

The cgi was awesome, graphics, choreography and costumes all really nice, parts were genuinely beautiful but if the film ain't doing much for me that doesn't matter.

Think a lot would hinge on whether you got this gimmick or liked it, I didn't, they were cool for set pieces and what they wanted to achieve in the movie but I just felt they weren't something I thought was interesting or that impressive.

It was always going one way, it was pretty predictable and I didn't feel or believe the emotion as I found the story a bit stupid, it just felt directionless and they were trying to do so much whilst achieving very little.

jcasterline-11406,7,Not terrible.,"Fair origin film. Generally, Marvel's character introduction films are slightly above average affairs. They need to introduce a character that some people may not be familiar with. This usually leads to a lengthy stretch of the beginnings of those movies to be slow. This movie, however, felt like it kicked off fairly quickly and maintained a decent pace. After the ramp up to Infinity War and Endgame, and bombastic, wild action in them, this movie feels like a step back. However, you need to keep in mind that this is the beginning of a new story arc in the MCU. Build up is necessary. In that regard, this movie is a success.

With that said, I do have a few gripes.

Awkwafina grated on my ears and nerves for the whole movie. A personal preference. I don't remove a star for that.

Many of the action sequences were well done but filmed with the cameras too close. Had they been filmed from a greater distance they would have been more impressive and flowed better overall.

js-66130,6,CROUCHING NOCORN,"Twelve year old me loved this movie. It is big, bold, colourful, action packed, fun, funny, and has flying dragons. Cranky codger me says no to flying dragons. Sorry to any preteens peeking in (highly unlikely), flying dragons are a silly figment of someone's imagination. A movie with flying dragons is difficult to take seriously. Sorry kids. There is also some shocking news about Santa Clause, but let's save that for another day.

The good news here: Marvel again steps up to the plate in their inclusivity transformation of what movie making can and should be. They also manage to keep the rest of their superhero Universe from ruining what is a pretty good martial arts film by inserting the briefest of brief Marvel cameos to keep the all important story arc threaded. As usual for the studio, the supporting cast is pretty sweet. Ben Kingsley with a Ringo accent absolutely slays. Ronnie Chieng in a brief but outrageous cameo absolutely slays. Awkwafina in a major cameo absolutely slays. Tony Leung as the dark father and ring master absolutely slays, slays a lot.

The bad news: let's face facts, it may not be possible to make a good martial arts movie. Just when things get interesting we get a fight sequence where combatants, while absorbing what should be lethal blows, magically fly backwards unscathed. Zero gravity time baby! Why is this a thing? Used to be done with wires, so very obvious, and oddly enough, even with CGI at the ready, we still get that bizarre old school wire look. Homage has its limits. And lastly and most sadly the rousing cast of secondary characters pretty well squeezes Simu Liu into a not so main character role. Kinda forgettable if truth be told. That's a problem. A big problem.

The really cool highlights in ""Shang-Chi"", like the morphing forest maze, are a series of disconnected sequences that seem parachuted in, not integral to the story. As is often the case in the Marvel Universe, someone in the art department went a little crazy. With ""Black Panther"" it was the robot rhinos, and here it is a bizarre shimmering, sequinned horse hybrid (a hornless unicorn, so a nocorn?). Oh and then there are the cute furry, winged animals (get ready for the Xmas plush toy stampede) who somehow survive without any orifices. No really: nothing goes in, nothing goes out, and yet it survives, and also communicates!

Shame about all these niggling details, but they do ruin what could be a grand cinematic experience, an epic of epic proportions, though relentlessly formulaic, a family affair that nicks Shakespearian conflict, culminating with volcanic battle scenes of archery, catapults, swords, and uh, oh yeah, flying dragons.

The Marvel Universe is making strides, especially with the dark and moody ""Black Widow"", and the hilariously over the top, potty-mouthed ""Deadpool"". ""Shang-Chi"" is a heroic stray away from the usual masked heroes in tights genre, but it just needs less than more. A lot less. Chop chop.

HabibieHakim123,8,Overall Movie Is Still Great But Not......,"For an MCU movie, i've seen better, and the movie still not on the level like Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Black Panther, Ant Man, and even Black Widow the recent one before this that everybody hate or think it just an alright film but i found it way better than this and it's a perfect movie (in terms of an MCU superhero solo movie), Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is still an exciting film with a dazzling special and visual effects, incredible action packed, and amazing performance, though the second part/place in the movie didn't work perfectly, and Shang-Chi And The Legend Of The Ten Rings is not one of my favorite and probably the least in the franchise and character but overall movie is still great.",26 September 2021
natsuka_arei,9,Funny movies with solid action,"I have low expectation for this one but this movie proved I am wrong. This movie exceed my expectations in all aspect. They got great heart-touching story, funny moments (a lot of funny scene. I can hear people laugh here and there. I love how Awkwafina can be both funny and beautiful at the same time, I became her fans in this movie), great costumes, moral of the story, etc.

This is only my personal opinion but I think the MC is kinda flat in personality. I can't really sympathy with him. The sidekicks in this story have more interesting background or personality (for ex. Katy, the little sister/xiangling, the father) than the MC.

The only downside that really disappointing is the final battle because they overuse CGI and the CGI looks like a cheap budget movie. The best fighting scene they have is the fight in the bus.",24 September 2021

danielortgiess,6,"Superb special fx poor acting, humor far from funny",I just don't understand why this flick got such high ratings. You can go crazy with special effects but if the acting is poor and the attempts to bring some humor u can trow this whole concept in the bin. The humor is what makes me connect with the actor's in most of the marvel films. This was really lame as and it made me want to leave the theater everytime a lame ass attempt to have some sort of funny dialogue. The main characters are not very strong characters. Most of the dialogue was annoying. I just don't understand other reviews and why this film is rated so good. Its not only about special effects.,23 September 2021
jnikhvvpc,7,"Lots of New, Yet Same Old Same Old","Shang Chi brings a lot of new dynamics to the MCU that have not been done in any of the subsequent Marvel movies to this point. The fight choreography with fantastic martial arts action being beautifully captured and edited to perfection, the accompanying score that really paces the scenes well, and at times breath taking cinematography. However, particularly in the third act, it tends to fall back on the tried and true Marvel formula that is become tiresome to even someone like me who is a huge Marvel fanboy. The Mandarin is one of the greatest MCU villains we have ever seen. I wish this was the true Iron Man 3 villain. However there is comic relief and exposition characters accompanying our heroes throughout much of the film that takes the bite out of the stakes. The third act continues with the faceless army versus B characters complete with a huge CGI spectacle at the end. You can seek how this borrows from other firms prior, particularly Black Panther. A fun watch, but unfortunately not the home run they were going for.",19 September 2021

blott2319-1,8,"Could be better, still enjoyable","As a MCU fanatic, I've been trying to get excited about the movies they have released post-Endgame, but it has been a challenge. That particular film was such a perfect finale for the series that I have struggled with the efforts to get the storyline going again. It doesn't help that they have been so scattered in topics, lacking a single core group to bring them all together. Shang-Chi is another random hero that I only knew vaguely from references in the comics, but I never read any of his books back when I was a collector. I appreciated that this film brought a new style to a MCU movie. The blending of Wuxia into a superhero story was a fun choice.

There were also quite a few great actors in this film including Tony Leung, Ben Kingsley, Michelle Yeoh, and I'd even include Awkwafina in that category. I can certainly see how some other people might struggle with Awkwafina's schtick, but I find her comedic timing to be great, and I was laughing along the whole time. However, the one major name I left out of the ""great actors"" is Simu Liu. Sadly, I found him a little bland. He was okay with the comedy, but I certainly don't see him stacking up with the legends that have come before in the MCU. Heck, Benedict Wong has only about 5 minutes of screentime in this film, but still made a greater impression on me than Simu Liu.

Digging into the story of Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, I'd say it's a fine origin story, even if it was highly predictable. This is the kind of movie where you can stay 10 steps ahead of it, and that is unfortunate. I think that's the biggest problem with the entire film, while it's fun and engaging it also feels like a rough carbon copy of things that came before. It's a movie that is emulating a number of Wuxia films from the past, but it's not as good as any of them. It's a movie that is following the tropes of a superhero origin story, and once again isn't on the level of the best of the genre. You can't fault their ambition, but their execution was lacking.

All that negativity is not to say that Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings is a bad film. In fact, I enjoyed the entire time in the theater, and was genuinely invested in the story. I thought it handled the links to the MCU well, but without feeling like it had shameless pandering for the fans, or devolving into obscure references only people like myself would understand. The film had some gorgeous visuals, and created its own world in a way that managed to be both unique but still consistent with the style of other MCU movies. There were personal stakes in the film, despite the fact that the ending fell into a giant CGI battle that felt unnecessary. I can't say that Shang-Chi will rise into the upper echelon of my MCU rankings, but it's better than some that came before.",15 September 2021
henry8-3,7,Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,"Car valet (Liu) and his friend are attacked by warriors working for his father who is a 1,000 year old owner of the 10 rings which gives him phenomenal powers. He and his sister are eventually captured by their father who reveals what his strange intentions are and how they fit in.

Wonderful action packed fantasy adventure is brilliantly bought to life by a great cast and some great action sequences including some staggeringly beautiful fantasy scenes. Extraordinary how this almost child like fantasy film can so successfully bridge a chase scene across modern day San Francisco with battles with dragons whilst maintaining a goodly degree of drama snd humour. Huge fun.",15 September 2021
thatfilmperson,10,A perfect Marvel movie,"If you liked: Jackie Chan films Bruce Lee films Doctor Strange

Note: as I always say Marvel and DC films can really only be compared to one another, within their own segment of the movie industry. But even if I were to compare ""Shang-Chi"" to any other film, it would have been a 9/10.

A perfect Marvel movie. Trust me, I've watched all 25 of them and the only Marvel films that come close to the richness of story, character development and sheer epicness of Shang-Chi are Doctor Strange, Thor Ragnarok and the last two Avengers. The film perfectly balances story and character development with action scenes so that throughout the whole two hours you never get tired of neither. There are no unnecessary filler scenes, there aren't any 40-min long scenes explaining the childhood background of the main character you sometimes see in such films; the flashbacks of the past are smartly intertwined as short clips within the overarching main story. The fights are absolutely amazing, obviously inspired by Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee moves (with a pinch of Kill Bill). The story is as deep and as personal as it can get for a Marvel film (honestly better than most drama films nowadays); and some scenes are as epic and vast as the final battles in Endgame or the last Hobbit movie. This is what Mulan and Raya should have looked like. And the great thing is that it doesn't rely on any of the previous Marvel movies whatsoever - a fully standalone project with completely new characters.

You must watch it in a theater if you can.",15 September 2021
namarazanchi,8,AMAZING!,"HUGE step-up from Black Widow. This movie made it onto my top 3 favorite MCU movies list.

The new unique MCU origin story of Shang-Chi wasn't that original but it was still very fun to go through. Sometimes you forget you're watching a Marvel movie. Everything from the visuals, music and fight choreography was amazing and on point. There was also a good amount of humor inside but also a good amount of touching moments.

gcsman,7,"""Welcome to the circus""","It's always fun to go to the theater for a new MCU production -- a chance to see something **new** that you know will be well produced and will keep on stretching their shared universe of superheros. With Shang-Chi it looks like their Phase 4 is well and truly launched, and you can already glimpse what Marvel Studios' overall approach is going to be. (More below.)

Just like Black Widow was Marvel's run at doing a James Bond-type film, Shang-Chi is their try at doing the Chinese martial arts thing. The result is a kind of compromise Westernized version that falls between two poles. For sure though, you'll be entertained. There's more than enough action, a lot of strikingly beautiful settings, and fun characters. But before I forget -- the mid-credits scene is one of the best they've ever done and totally worth staying for. (That's where the quote I put in the title above comes from -- a certain familiar character telling Shang-Chi to sure, come on in and join the craziness.) It does the usual thing of tossing the baton forward to whatever the next production will be, but it's stylistically so clever that it really stands out.

And the film itself: it fills up its 2:12 runtime with a whole lot of material and a lot of characters. Maybe too much. The third act in particular veers off onto a fantasy-type track that doesn't entirely fit well with the previous hour and a half of setup, and the scenes in that last section suddenly feel more rushed. Gone are the days of the first Iron Man or Thor or Ant-Man movies with their lean, linear storylines and single well defined themes. Instead, Marvel now seems to want to overstuff every one of their productions, even if they involve 'secondary' MCU characters, and turn them into epics. More and bigger is not always better, is it?

I did like the cast. Marvel always does an impressive job bringing in good people. Nice to see there are no less than 4 (!) major roles for females, as opposed to 2 for males, and they mix and match well. Of the mostly young cast though, I thought the older pair (Tony Leung, Michelle Yeoh) really stood out -- they effortlessly dominate the screen when they are on. Leung's character could have been a stock, one-dimensional scenery-chewing villain, but he's much more nuanced than that. Simu Liu (the lead role, Shang-Chi) is not exactly a great actor just yet, but he's athletic and cute and attractive with a sense of humor and for this role he doesn't need to be much more than that. Awkwafina, as Katy, does her usual turn with comic relief and side commentary with a dash of romance. As for Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley) -- that came out of nowhere and he's absolutely out of place, but somehow it works partly because of his pet that rises to Disney levels of cuteness.

About Phase 4. The first three cycles introduced and used particular major characters that were all required to fit under the Avengers umbrella. Now it's the post-Avengers era and from their scheduled series of releases up through 2023, we'll see a much more diverse slate of characters and stories that don't obviously fall under a single umbrella. If they do have a Master Plan for something equivalent to the Avengers, it's hard to see what it is. Maybe, they'll use this new freedom just to show us interesting stories in a bigger universe.",11 September 2021

jordyntsmith,7,Martial Arts and MCU,"Effectively an origin story for Shang-Chi that marries the styles of superhero and martial art films wonderfully, and adds some much needed intrigue back into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).

I did legitimately enjoy the movie! It tries new things and is one of the more enjoyable MCU films. However, it did not quote tip the scale into becoming one of the best MCU movies in my opinion. At times, it felt a little too fantastical for my liking (especially the third act).

The story, visuals, and characters are all pretty great! But I find the film mostly suffered from an ending that could have been more grounded in reality than it was. I am happy though, to see Shang-Chi added into the MCU.",11 September 2021
