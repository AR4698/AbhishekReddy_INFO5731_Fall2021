dont give 1010 star thing close thing make different bunch superhero movie halfway already invested character origin movie focus two character make understand theyre coming prepare sequel clear character people depth comparing origin movie would say take cake every fight scene felt tense also dance cinematography also brilliant could tell character thinking felt angle hue alone also really enjoyed wasnt shangchi also character life related situation said say favourite part invested felt several character could understand villain shangchi main cast made clear thinking sometimes without word saying something else shangchi welcome excited see come next
filmis brilliant without spoiler there much say overall 910
saw trailer press wasnt hyped im honest saw must sayexpectations blown water something quite unique refreshing thoroughly enjoyed would recommend
witnessed something way beyond expectation fully packed well directed surely best part 1 franchise
hater want say film awesome terrible joke every 5 minute loved history interesting
hesitant watch know generic movie mistake guess feel wasted money boring might well streaming
""
personally im huge scene score came surprise acting character development impressive right scaling plot never felt slow built song moment animation completely blew away ive seen every new cinema past plenty animation cinema moment truly incredible would recommend anyone go see easily favourite maybe outright favourite
start goodbutsoon begin flashback nosense humour anticlimax scene mandarin seriously shang chi worst sad pricipal actor job well character bad bone
bland pandering chinese market mystical martial art nothing explained there tie main universe drive plot forward pointless cameo amount shrug emoji hero dont pay see avoid
cinematography bit slow fighting scene middle stop stare talk best close best one watch theater

iconic excellent combat perfect new start
new character always astonishing looking ahead timely update
superb superb superb must watch theatre

got admit wasnt particularly blown away anything might even say bored dont get wrong spectacle location nice costume design sound design etc overall soft release worth seeing theater specially followup endgame biggest problem underwritten lead muddled personality reason covered devoid charm personality dialogue next issue humor didnt land supporting lead awkwafina isnt normal loud self thats supposed funny every time open mouth role supportive little dramatic questioned even doesnt ultimately matter another forgettable character given importance role deserves finally third act weak there balancing problem stake cant feel tension weight there lot superficial cant end feel safe plot written way appeal china considering mandarin portrayed end appealing specific certainly doesnt feel bound happen introduced different aspect narrative also doesnt feel comic book generic
movie biggest selling point hand hand combat done exceptionally well use environment camera movement added flow intensity scene character development interaction also fine criticism final fight got bit cgiheavy really didnt need super fantastical element definitely took away character development building kind felt higherups said need something grandiose despite rest kept grounded fact side character able pull mvp hit thin air enjoyable truly breathtaking scene there plenty memorable martial art scene go around growing kung fu movie think youll enjoy much
introduction new hero humor wait see back justice fresh take 10 ring
watching shang chi almost immediately see follows formula every thing excels choreography choreography best seen universe maybe even cinema general character shang chi played simu liu addition say character especially character katyplayed awkwafina character flat childish making almost annoying though believe fault writer awkwafina another aspect cameo mention avoid spoiler say definitely favorite part general give shangchi 9 10
first time couple year since 2019s captain introduces u brand new hero simu liu rather impressively first asked role twitter brings u shangchi perhaps issue ending ultimately fun funny ride type perfecting last 13 year talented somewhat aimless shaun simu liu life san francisco working valet friend katy awkwafina he attacked bus he forced back world father ruthless terrorist xu wenwu tony chiuwai leung first visiting sister returning ten ring compound shangchi decides use skill defend late mother sacred homeland invasion father control ten mystical arm ring weapon grant owner immortality unearthly power black widow considered wobble despite fact thought perfectly fine important come back something undeniably excellent shangchi perfect balance humour established last year tweaked slightly closely resemble type asian led film weve seen previously jackie chan style bus fight crouching tiger hidden dragonesque flashback fight shang chi parent there lovely link wider including return benedict wongs wong trevor slattery ben kingsleys iron man 3 character whose masquerading role mandarin mcus divisive moment perfect ending perhaps little rushed lacking moment two redemption earning xu wenwu peak future character 10 ring organisation interesting addition plus first real step might route next big bad excellent stuff
expectation low maybe due fact wasnt much hype around men delivered awesomely
shangchi legend ten ring absolutely list favorite movie 2021 full hyped film ultimately left disappointed life every bit hype beginning end best ive seen general long time choreography especially performed michelle yeoh menger zhang fala chen stunt double felt poetry motion everything done much grace elegance want end simu liu brought charisma charm shangchi delivering amazing sequence nothing short fitting role surprise awkwafina unbearable assumed would lose momentum 3rd act slows bit take deeper dive quickly pick back head final battle set cgi used creates breathtaking shot add greatness fan worth going see
shangchi instantly entered top 5 movie much adore visuals beautiful villain compelling last sequence isnt predictable superhero movie often character level depth often missing supporting character superhero movie pleased didnt marginalize xialing wouldve easy dont know much different discipline martial art seems similar avatar last airbender drew inspiration different real world fighting style different fighter compare acting movie consider best produced infinity war ragnarok winter soldier etc shangchi notch blow every water come choreography bus scene first act easily become favorite sequence origin film often fall trap shangchi doesnt maybe many didnt know much character even typical trope training sequence done better shangchi didnt linger youth much

okay simu liu son seemingly immortal master ten ring always see tony leung hope soaked disney wind opposing dad awkwafina slacker sortof girlfriend fine lead menger zhang sister michelle yeoh aunt always see hope soaked disney grown increasingly fond martial art film last couple decade decline musical reason dont make movie try theyre often embarrassing people dont unreality people bursting song expressing emotion dance prefer solid commonplace people floating space kick head fight choreography dance fight leung fala chen meet fall love challenge dance graceful astaire rogers problem aplenty there immense amount exposition starting twenty minute chinese im sure ben kingsley fake mandarin iron man 3 present except certain remnant star power connecting rest still expectation set particularly high time
overall disappointing expected another generic flop obviously make money nobody never heard superhero

hit somehow succeeded expanding vast without really forcing go show richness american pocket world culture go long way solid sequence cgi delivers mind shangchi without mesmerizing tony leung michelle yeoh doesnt fight title character ok awkwafina still isnt funny wait watch tv experience cinema first

mix levity family drama cant relate seen since captain cat hacking tesseract hairball cant relate visual masterpiece element fan legend zelda breath wild swoon maybe something everyone relate 10 ring ring bell check iron man 3 refresher also make sure hang around mid endcredit scene
absolutely amazing wish see defiantly watch
introduction character pretty epic ending looking forward seeing shang chi

watched shangchi ten ring despite title sounding 1940s black white detective dee type visually stunning stunning scenery magical creature gorgeous costume noholdsbarred fight scene much dancing fighting name issue however first think worried offending china chinese people come across safe far much dignity job interview would position senior vice president chinese equivalent louvre even akwafina usually count deliver raunchy bellylaugh time composed restrained im also wondering bothered including shangchis sister doesnt really anything except moody resentful majority even afterscene shes far tell entire point inclusion get shangchi macau bonus point overused hong kong singapore dignity plenty opportunity could upped humour quotient chinese people dignified famous also ribald sophisticated sense humour would loved see sly dig western culture commentary difference east west cant tell guy spends life isolated chinese compound state seamlessly segue macau urban lifestyle kind thing stereotypical getting married going get real job conversation basically could really done something superhero thing really want see guide creature see beautifully rendered fu dog example mesmerized watching tiny little movement ear flick muscle twitch reacting bug bite movement fur mane magnificent many others clue looked chinese mythological creature would love know
disappointing entry black widow shangchi return form needed bounce back solid performance setpieces fun sequence emotional depth humour type need see big screen go along journey fantastical element also paced well intriguing runtime direction solid character get amount screen time develop well placed flashback sequence martial art fight pretty well done cgi creature look interesting design special effect overall well done didnt think could keep going proved still make stuff care 810
lot fun watch cast made character believable funny told held well scene blend everything nice watch something take away get lost cant wait watch
let start saying damnnn made absoluut banger developed antagonist cgi stunning watch let alone fight scene beginning end big smile first phase 4 expect bigger thing happen course fan go watch also opinion best made definitely worth money phase 4 destined greatness
extremely boring absolutely predictable plot worth paying attention medium acting katy total cringe 90 fighting scene
ive seen twice going third time weekend fight scene chef kiss youre living rock havent seen yet
production anything boring representation chinese culture visuals plot indirect full gap unexplained thing shallow characterising certain thing turn something else next second quick shift plot bit forced comedy lack interesting hook disappointment
funny unique moment overall think quite weak werent moment fully think sequel could potential left cinema without much excitement dont get wrong many film top storyline character developed ect think 6 reasonable score would give 65 option 7 bit generous dont believe 1010 review 10 reserved cinematic masterpiece dark night infinity war

character bit incoherent straight contradict characterization time plot need bunch unneeded deuxex machina convenience writer trapped corner reason thats happens get 2021 mortal kombat ww84 expendables writer also awkwafina destroying every type scene dramatic epic also comedic one worst acting ive ever seen type joke awkward nonsense start finish role ridiculously large dumb comic relief liu actually pretty lead character potentially shangchi world beautiful everything super fun watch futurewithout awkwafine better writer
beautiful entertaining however plot could basic character development limited could fit scene alongside quite weird choice make shauns friend essential character development future movie reason part liability time thats reserve note movie really deserve
stopped trying longer want risk movie get praise beginning shaun actually likeable progress kinda stuff motivation almost inexistent rest character bland uninteresting plot place boring filled explanation flashback explanation make long fight scene start become huge filled cgi make boring conclusion weekend see family come tv kid love adult forget 3 day generic tasteless
trying say lot place doesnt genuine nature eastern film clearly show american crowd appeasing made say asian look casting asian others amazing fails many aspect acting visuals always expert marketing mediocre sometimes even worse make money didnt heart right place first instance dont even connect shang chi character neither anyone role feel cookedup without genuine touch chinese hk film strong theme purpose feel make character marvel usual formulaic movie ripping story many comic look could touch upon aspect visuals overall average average since close post pandemic time everyone eager watch helped shine pcness hollywood american culture shove mindset let people make genuine film accept way rather poking nose film give mixed bag approach ruined mulan screwed mindset making approach im sure cover eternals still super hero movie junk seems

like pacing shang chi lot thing built tale try make origin fit far series information might worry pace surprisingly done super well never really dragging moving blinding pace mostly shang chi combination tale keep thing moving flying important element connect character cast get ample time give u backstories piece together cluse dynamic drama puzzle sacrifice come character development trailer may thinking modern martial art sense would right however take step go beyond punch instead give character soul layer compared legendary film past shang life complicated torn light dark sister well experiencing drama manner parallel main protagonist even antagonist layer far beyond normally get group loved well line mixed together make melodramatic family fit naturally universe surprise cameo cant say much without spoiling disappointed show several question answered character return many laugh manner familiar fan inclusion character also hold important albeit stretch plot element give little meaning behind loved choice made include big picture cultural influence black panther african culture shang chi integrates much cultural value asian province costume stunning take traditional attire bringing past light also sewing modern style jazz outfit concept family honor custom practicing marshal art honoring family wellintegrated help give predictable tale extra kung fu kick architecture setting breathes new life typical cityscape made famous legend ten ring scream asian mythology seeped int heir history loved well thing merged tale though little predictable

honestly level excels casting perfect world building creative beautiful faithful asian root cgi location shoot breathtaking fighting best ive ever seen even training ground sequence exquisite grace balanced heart concerned awkwafina would take humour campy low truly showed serious dramatic chop comic relief gave honour shakespearean stage giant ben kingsley homegrown simu liu perfect part performance world class could go raving ill conclude feedback saying every way powerful solo representation asian culture black panther african culture gathered feedback left theatre got rating 75 felt needed content 8 saw many thing commented ive read criticism storytelling choppy didnt find chapter book completely working together create world content design upon leaving cinema going give 9 superb 10 reflecting dont know could done make better give 10 perfect 10 superhero adventure
chemistry simu awkafina fact shang chi doesnt fall far mandarin tree fresh take super hero know need done doesnt conflict make choice act really showed true strict upbringing made character different hero internal struggle shang make hard decision absolutely loved want see universe thats new cuz usually say cant wait see avenger katy shang need wedding bell ive never wanted couple two
doesnt really know supposed drama fantasy flick superhero bromance comedy try way hard appeal every possible viewer achieves nothing started well really awesome martial art scene got confusing hole plot swiss cheese instance 14year old trained assassin apparently got bullied school really guy played british actor even plot moment showed moment done overthetop magical creature probably supposed get awwws female audience disappointing thing interesting badass sister got treated way woman typically get treated hollywood got totally ignored male hero get ring deserve least half male storytelling finest usual

fan simi liu least favourite character kims convenience still liked first half well paced quite entertaining though building bamboo fight done way better year ago jackie chan rush hour second half however drag towards end especially dragon fight seen dragon fight nothing original exciting wanted thing end still worth theatre watch bus fighttony leung awkafina
wushu entering universe martial art classic asia creature subtitle mythology want 2 hour escapism go see
ive watching film year almost always enjoy often come underwhelmed shang chi actually managed pleasantly surprise think dragged slightly third act really enjoyed manages balance humour seriousness far better property also incorporates aspect film without feeling forced instead adding worldbuilding possibly best obviously take lot influence jackie chan film believe stunt coordinator worked chan past acting simu liu really shining wasnt massive fan awkwafinas character start find liking development final act think shang chi manages take work well polish doesnt mean without flaw enjoy emotional link villain shang chi thought far many flash back telling u relationship developed also think third act bit let evolving pretty basic cgi fight personal edge lent well rivalry shang chi win wu lost also big plot hole thing dont make sense score underwhelming im massive fan villain costume design however flaw still enjoyable likely watch cast cinematography different usual stuff offer didnt shy away using lot subtitle character speaking lot chinese enjoyable id recommend fan 710
youll get vibrant color mograph wont get blood hardcore feeling adult watching something wasnt made kid ok always
worthy praise truly represented people history lore legend early report said asian version black panther could truth despite sale black panther hand worst released black widow snatched crown get invested character cast better side kick unattractive funny awkwafina probably would considered 9 dont know blessed asian female kevin hart title awful everything hate voice hate acting face 100 cabage patch know nothing comic truly want know chang father legacy ring would assume explored sequel writer director deserve praise unfolded told phase 4 looking promising aa strong entry worthy praise iron man got shang may new poster boy pace probably could quickened 220 probably least 10 minute minimum long said acted directed well irritant awkwafina comparing kevin hart insult kevin asian female jerry lewis clown could live lifetime without ever seen
highly anticipated held expectation massive fan fully engaged start finish fight sequence amazing different movie making unique every actor gave wonderful performance well im rating 1010 dragon sequence towards end awesome start seemed drag bit long still entertaining though even youre fan still highly recommend seeing dont need much background seeing obviously youre fan sure piece thing together overall shangchi stunning

studio brings joke dazzling visuals character development hour dont care character dysfunctional drama family chosen seen million time first time felt sleepy feel wasted money despite availing super tuesday offer suicide squad far much better term storyboard overrated black panther whats next shangchi origin

shangchi absolutely brilliant go see earliest convenience fight scene almost balletic verge tear roaring laughter part came cinema feeing way seeing black panther needed easily straight top5 film
omg mid post credit scene ohh amazing fanatstic
physical raw fighting sequence alone turn giddy kid glued screen hyper focused miss single beat consensus miss almost beat co fighting fast wont able catch even could pause rewind miss type movie focusing physical aspect fighting turning artform struggle force character master skill perfection attempting use result failure physical fight deadly stake higher surprisingly move lot soul missed older similar movie rich landscape interesting character creature also splendid cast attached badass woman got fight fair amount loved watch cant wait watch couple time catch fighting beat missed
nothing innovative cool bunch pointless visual effect usual cringe humor movie
first weve seen since pandemic enoyable hope see character
best superhero origin movie kungfu element stunning portray opening ten ring history fantastic martial art scene casting viewing experience touch friendship family course marvel universe
grew 70 80 90 sold comic book collection bought new car full scuba gear 20 90 addressing real life issue pcp heroin related issue bgrade comic time didnt even bother reading predictable crap waste money magnitude disneyland garbage insult stan lee
""
ten ring ten bracelet leave research fan debate accurate orignal comic focusing must say flat right get magical land cultural mythical accuracy sadly pushed aside writer animator retain standard plot character poor dialogue didnt help odd joke rarely succeed disappointed poor attempt capture classical contemporary kung fu element fight limited opportunity largely missed apart next grandeur phase would surprised see another attempt reboot five ten year
ill brief clearly much effort thought funding gone flick go show assemble right ingredient recipe still make meal live cg stale transition always evident solid storyline padding average actor support role know hero ultimately triumph get journey underwhelming
generic super hero fails connect emotionally audience seen 6 minute short anime named shelter could connect short time however 2hrs long failed get emotionally connected charecters looking mindless sequence expected
incredible start finish cast perfect mind blowing special effect cant give enough praise go see
fighting bad character indeed entirely evil character without mistake weakness besides loved storyline character acting loved music give damn colour actor skin film awesome thats
starter cinematography cgi pretty nice however thats positive end fighting choreography ok bad example even mortal combat way better way le also follows usual formula lot cgi fighting scene time blew roof making scene feel completely detached world theyre concerning character shangchi isnt really part taking step back lot thing character time spotlight done reason thing causing neglected basically background character female lead plain annoying really serf purposeyoull know instantly appears overthetop strong woman actually getting screentime dont get wrong actress act nicely way presented way character come established unnatural feel shes someone activated irlcheats feel took real shortcut character whilst much couldve done make really likeable immersable viewer however way handled make feel 2d cardboard character used cheat max stats dialogue abyssmal really lacking content feel something hungover student would drum lastminute late night party dialogue feel wooden time really unnatural dont even get started humor overly forced really bad feel know want want go dozen way leaving much clutter sidestep feel coherent chosen 1 2 thing stuck could decent flick
way fanboysmarvel worst fan base toxic childish praise cgi crap pure comedy trash joke know already cheesy cringi lame bcz course praised doesnt matter make dog barking two hour toxic fan base still say masterpiece 2 star entertaining scene lady annoying asf really dare say suicide squad clown james gunn better full cgi trash opinion watching cartoon stupidalmost fighting scene enjoyment incels

first whats people day aspiration really low claim happened telling writer get million come nonsense cgi alright help cant tell shouldve focused conflict father son wasted
actor choreographer overshadowed incredibly poor script many thing cliched rushed generally bad found cringing many part could fantastic son daughter overcome misguided grief father became full misjudged moment undeveloped character cgi mess

tbh really marvel looked really fresh high expectation also ready disappointed well omg way better imagined real well choregraphed fight scene everything blow badass woman shown inferior thank god sexualised dilema bad guy bad guy humour thank awkwafina respect asian culture least huge mistake direct disrespect expert ending spectator satisfied still let possibily story yeah
fighting sick point say first half better 2nd overall fun couple dumb part enjoyable 76
amazing scene incredibily beautiful fighting scene bomb acting plot well even casting overall pretty best solo movie definetely best marvel debut far
1010 excellent superbly told flourished colour visual spirit awesome fight sequence diverse cast shine role amongst load moment humour bit drama tad romance best scene seen since captain america winter soldier albeit lot difference two fighting style still stand individually go see gold class recliner snack two highly recommended even follow franchise worth watching humour
went real open mind say kind disappointed acting felt par felt slow moving didnt really go anywhere loved fight scene though really cool see pure hand hand combat martial art centre overall pleased walking cinema didnt feel attached much character either pace

really hoping shangchi couldnt mainly three reason first severe fact found bored especially last hour spent time hoping could ability skip 10 second youtube second problem fact shangchi interesting character far treat surely potential clear high future still hope think preferred least four character protagonist finally plot various hole especially regarding ten ring criminal organization visuals wasnt enough p midcredit scene best really liked
imagine hobbs shaw hattie work primary driving force take away comedy make le boring youve got dont wanna harsh trash maybe poor quality script lack practice super hero presence aesthetic whats wrong day since daredevil writingproductions going south

scene really well choreographed felt brought nothing novel didnt feel thrilled excited watching
entertaining fight scene regard universe ive seen different ethnicity setting storyline us bring another superhero
magic watch moving picture watch till jaw drop
thought really fight scene character would definitely recommend people watch
felt disney production supernatural aspect especially seem sourced disney workflow character development especially mandarin stuff seemed glossed final bos battle bit cgi overload least much despite specific pick enjoyable americana perspective id put bit black panther time review word said make followup questionable best two trailer middle ending interesting fluff important especially since followup may happen
say looking forward first connection avenger etc intrigued see would whole enjoyable fun watch first instinct watching little mixed odd start say least didnt idea going go first instinct katy also mixed felt trying force humour found character really annoying however get going get better better katy becomes character character development arc whole truly phenomenal best part character seeing develop throughout plot blunt yes truly unique uniquely done many way dont want give anything would spoil anything really expect thats say ill shut ill say well worth watching superhero watch overall fun visually pleasing brilliant watch recommend
far superhero movie retreading ground pizza slicer struggling cut dull crust particularly current climate overdone overrated movie shangchi stand fun endearing take rollercoaster humble joke friend fighting brute bus eventually epic battle expected compared movie feeling make care im supposed cheering first place shangchi much likeable worthy carrying formula think perfectly came character enough invested enchanted event chinese flavour help give rhythm depth least surface level still end day another overbudgeted blockbuster make le sense along watch given tight first half find taken insertion trevor slattery obligatory cute little critter know everything moment inevitable final battle well done exhilarating still exchanged logic gravity another slog chaotic battlefield versus evil also wished shangchis father would start make sense end seemed enigmatic layered beginning came across stereotypical tyrant dad end overall id say definitely worth watch worth hype sea superhero movie lead pack bunch doesnt stray better worse

every time hear opening theater get chill happy saw theater shangchi legend ten ring kick new wave excited journey lie ahead character narrative score overall totally worth watch make sure stay midafter credit scene
loved easy follow along scene even quite funny either looking amazed smiling throughout entire
first fight scene nauseating fight scene well choreographed easy follow well executed character motivation could better also feel prolonged bmw commercial time
origin welcoming hit shangchi awesome blend telling adventure brilliant visual effect character likable make laugh make feel right amount favor dont listen bad review go see
got back cinema loved loved loved got excited next phase safe say mandarin fast become favourite character hail king
personally 10 10 enjoyed whole way able ignore minor problem enjoy martial art stuff lot movie however minor plot hole confusing aspect people 10 10 gave 9 10
latest flick shangchi magnificently assembled stellar cast crazy rich asian star awkwafina michelle yeoh combined interesting performance tony leung villainous mandarin simu liu lead welcoming addition family martial art skill add evergrowing universe visuals fight choreography interesting soundtrack boot make think martial art fantasy rather typical also took notice moral value quirk usually seen asian family began remind recent crazy rich way term valuing heritage root learning past doesnt dictate become many year later 2019 san diego comiccon simu liu spoke part humble speak ive seen make sense said panel citing black panther chadwick boseman respect influence taking lead role chadwick helped open door took made audience look thats transpired since 2008 cant wait see else shangchi go next recommend
best superheroes recommend watch
beautiful there ever set design world building character choice top notch possibly best fight choreography ive ever seen outside traditional kungfu film could see putting without getting bored absolutely beautiful work art plot point definitely meant set scene thats fighting supposed acting choice little im willing sacrifice order experienced fighter play role tony leung crushed absolute standout simu liu treasure awkwafina made blast michelle yeoh fala chen added amazingly beautiful artistry depth
sceptical whole chinese casting worried would end another black panther howwved pleasant surprise captured chinese culture flawlessly choreography probably even better winter soldier lot style humor however plot weakness expected
best cinematic experience live best film ever comical relief right place casting without doubt top notch wonderful way introduce new avenger
must watch simple origin super back bang
visually stunning scene general fan enjoy
finally released isnt complete abomination heavy choreography clear shot villain well put together ambiguity salvation fluff chinese sequence actor excellent however american counterpart performed poorly viewer may find american humour entertaining awkwafinas character omitted wouldve 810 long worth watch youre martial art superheroes
hard believe destin daniel cretton directed complete contrast previous work tony leung chiu wai reason watch arent sucker superhero movie shang chi prof scorceses point movie despite surprisingly entertaining see major blockbuster nonusa centric point view shang chi best movement timed humour martial art fight scene ending theme park ride eye soaring vfx two dragon supposedy fighting dont know due excess use colour whole shang chi typical summer blockbuster bound entertain demographic linear storyline utilisation tony leung chiu wais talent bit underwhelming
bus fight scene best scene entire scene alone deserves watched biggest screen possible shang chi benefited unknown character give opportunity shine bright development really fast paced even final act succumbs typical esque leaf pretty solid feeling leaving cinema really superb martial art spectacle step phase 4 miss two post credit scene middle scene exciting last pretty intriguing bring
another global treath another villain gonna kill entire reallity speaking abault whats name villain oh cant remember another secret organization shape history take government bla bla bla script bad character forced even cgi much cgi cgi
visual second half reminded kong godzilla v kong avatar recent chinese movie best action scene
decent fun adventure much run mill superhero day got fight scene cg decent share joke beyond shang chi another wasted opportunity plot shallow really make sense never quite get shang chi hated dad much exactly dad feeling towards kid plot take whatever way convenient get next big scene character development even consistency nevertheless fine adventure roller coaster dont care acting telling fit bi solid 7
yet another appreciate actually im really glad exists diverse character nail shangchi simu liu give performance motivation isnt exactly clear character see origin job giving u somewhat compelling character looking forward seeing however character arent anywhere close performance everyone tony leung giving performance villain isnt character wise really adored villain motivation finally get true villain motivated grief inability accept loss loved love refreshing see weak didnt engage much hard understand motivation anyone except villain plot progress quickly hard remember individual beat kinda meld film thing stand visuals sequence sequence final battle others felt lackluster mixed bag regard always visuals part occasional weird visual effect doesnt get absolutely horrible production design surprisingly set look really cool obvious spent lot time really isnt lot say hand lot thing feel standard would recommend checking still
dont get wrong visual colourfully fantastical point view amazing come love intricate detailed fall flat doesnt make sense universe built point certain rule historic lore completely discarded think villain worst least relatable entire franchise made sense even climactic battle thing happening werent explained kind accept seeing possible without understanding happening unfortunately character depth cast poor certain character sort sake real purpose direction closest character main guy dont often say infanct ive said leaving cinema feel disappointed confused left thinking couldve done better
supplied everything needed beautiful culture storyline incredible choreography straight bad as fight scene overall must watch finally well written come
fireeeee disney messed mulan happy see shungchi pretty dope used 10 ring kungfu hustle also gave feeling first ironman definitely best film rewatch f f production directing cinematography cast

really enjoyed son went see saturday opening weekend glad cinematography choreography create visually stunning lot wuxia mixed scene involving mother people thing crouching tiger hidden dragon traditional fighting others bus scene fight outside skyscraper simu liu adorable wonderful although fan akwafina say job role michelle yeoh always beautiful engaging everything however tony leung amazing conveys many emotion effortlessly remorseless killing machine purpose although misguided believe he also smoking hot going reminds black panther strong line visually arresting dont need entire move plot would highly recommend seeing wont ne disappointed
loved high entertainment value achieves lot would expect new character firstly storyline wasnt neither common yet sufficient establish character hand hand combat sequence beautifully choreographed 3 totally different setting bus macau chinese wakanda see almost 60 time filled sequence remaining also mostly related drama background score set design overall theme felt fresh rate high comparatively previous launch movie definitely also lack aspect suit also doesnt add power bit disappointing generally suit serf purpose
beautiful aspect there there excellent acting really funny joke shocked knew budget 150m cgi perfect really hard well done end debut new hero cant wait see future shang chi rest avenger
absolutely loved imo best thats saying lot coming original screenplay excellent fight scene actor stuntmen villain unique agenda kill hero take world origin told perfectly superpower ring really interesting music fantastic finally bumped iron man 2 list
blend genre nicely part martial art part family drama part fantasy thing telling story different genre making fit within universe exactly best fight sequence within dynamic shang chi awkwafinas character nice dynamic two really play character play part none really feel pushed side villain also better one conflicting value see bad side also isnt predictable see going next finally director feel given lot freedom usual inside film told hasnt many film told sort style tackling sort issue feel significant moving forward issue black widow overall delivered everything want plus new stuff enjoyed mixed humour made laugh found funny lot forced humour people tired quick liner going frustrate bad biggest problem template sense joke massive cgi battle end tie different way humour work moment others fell forced overall thought overall shang chi exciting mix martial art family genre fantasy loved martial art aspect tell formula trying cheapen experience little bit however put together get yet another know whats coming next yet quite top teir overall im going give shang chi 810

really quit expected fan afraid would end black widow way better upgrade villain compared solo movie solo hero formula regular comedy hit point disastrous others background music fantastic mix modern classic chinese melody acting ok worst thing cgi especially last third world established wonderful feel detail character vague especially regarding mom end solo quit upgrade regarding solo movie
think rating obvious since im intrested seeing abomination wong protagonist nice cinematic

shangchi film feel full package lot brilliant trademark humour tongue cheek quip exceptional ill get bit also solid connection rest balanced well stand alone laying hint going fit wider phase 4 ill start shangchi famed quite simply awesome best hand hand combat seen sequence steeped chinese culture rhythmic style crouching tiger hidden dragon woven fabric cast brilliant simu liu fantastic lead id happy see grow big player awkwafina expected fantastic adding much effortless humour really love shangchi well explored interesting antagonist cant always said film phoned villain shangchi doesnt come close falling trap tony leung really sold role gave lot power emotion term plot fantastic job introducing u pretty obscure character lot exposition plenty flashback perhaps many appreciate lot background content feed u cant grumble much loved plot mystical magical much feeling epic adventure yet studio knocking park
may may find shangchi fun see theater full trope narration origin inner city urban flip distinctly asian character cgi assume real never quite translate real wellintentioned discovering doesnt seem know sure example tiein larger universe almost corporate necessity set subsequent movie versus narrative need set deeper inside there also profanity film often used momentary gag doesnt advance plot even final sequence land dark place confuse family storyline versus clarify youre looking fun night perhaps crew might enjoy might crave something significant

marvel newest solo introduces iconic hero thier vast collection hero certainly newer fan didnt grow master kungfu even stan lee charge company didnt create shangchi admitted comic ripoff bruce lee look style adding mystical possible alien influence view mistake true character reimaging mandarin found disappointing aside tired storyline become common film ending little top aside criticism ill give kudos cast wonderful cinematography ever get faithful adaption comic grew might shocked coming conclusion film 30 since dont recognize hero villain worse universe best
scene almost interrupted place gag ig live guy awkwafina rest really hard stay invested get serious long stretch third act crams character development goofiness multiple button robs could decent ending impact character left totally unaffected event making question whether sociopath

actually borderline giving 7 10 cant quite bring middle booooooring however whole really enjoy think whole cast rather origin shangchi awful lot attention seems given sister friend katy seemed odd sort odd way managed flesh character enough make seem character rather expendable supporting cast first third strongest seeing full fight scene bus shown trailer made appreciate choreography went final third fine wasnt bored middle though nah preferred black widow part new phase remnant carry felt fresh there also fairly ok humour lot miss mark though yeah go see
something different movie im iron man captain america shang chi connects public quickly simu liu funny character emotional katy wow cant say along luis antmans movie katy perfect partner shang chi beginning think classic character see 15 minute never return katy actually glued shang chi acting perfect couldnt handle laugh movie based bruce lee classic movie kill bill movie dont movie doesnt matter
excepting something new time around shangchi still feel brought formula scene definitly strong highlight along acting lot camera move dynamic colour costume design make stand among film technically massive achivment sadly hold go get weaker weaker becomes giant cgi fest every superhero ever obviously lot heart talent went project turning 13 year old still using repetitive formula shout guy looked morgan freeman real star show
wow underwhelmed cant bothered writing review boring character actor uncharismatic disney done expert dull uninspiring talentless garbage woke b yay

feel mash 10 old movie anc 20 plot weaved didnt enjoy much positive overall didnt leave feeling id seen something special didnt feel im diversity going different direction wasnt loved would see character bland uninspiring humour ok bit old old plot id guess youd call main theme felt bit daft cgi awesome graphic choreography costume really nice part genuinely beautiful aint much doesnt matter think lot would hinge whether got gimmick liked didnt cool set piece wanted achieve felt werent something thought interesting impressive always going way pretty predictable didnt feel believe emotion found bit stupid felt directionless trying much whilst achieving little felt long much longer run time wasnt id recommend felt disappointed maybe backwards though everyones saying make black widow dont get thought black widow brilliant way better also seems asian bit funny everyone call awkwafina
except cacophonous dragon fight acting decent visuals predictablethe whole fine pressing matter address yet watch felt got enough wong wong always wong

fair origin generally marvel character introduction film slightly average affair need introduce character people may familiar usually lead lengthy stretch beginning movie slow however felt kicked fairly quickly maintained decent pace ramp infinity war endgame bombastic wild feel step back however need keep mind beginning new arc build necessary regard success said gripe awkwafina grated ear nerve whole personal preference dont remove star many sequence well done filmed camera close filmed greater distance would impressive flowed better overall thats pretty much found better origin film nothing spectacular watchable
potential best movie ive seen music sequence cinematography wasted many silly joke scene made laugh except one fake mandarin let come character kathy acting woman bad character unnecessary wasnt nothing would changed also absurd someone probably never seen arrow life become arrow master day scene shang chi parent fought fight dance really bad thats isnt bad could better
different black panther already introduced civil war shangchi presented scratch using arch already familiar adding lot new character martial art glimpse new universe inside although moment abusing use fantastical element ben kingsley awkwafina provide comic relief gotten u used super enjoyable might high low always delivers
pretty way akwafinas character annoying sorry didnt
riveiw write septmber 2 deleted write new riveiw best ever show u something never got seen way cant wait meet shang chi agian see shang chi 2
suck jorge la mierda better iron man 3
everything hoping paid tribute classic kungfu film took inspiration added cinematic universe flare well
seriusly didnt even expected much lost intrest endgame watch phase4 sake continuation wholeheartedly saw kickass goosebump lit word music killed melody xu still ear fight coreography new spontaneous guy simu lui perfectly synced shangchi role absolute blast every age group irrespective sexcastecreed enjoy
ive seen better still level iron man captain america thor black panther ant man even black widow recent everybody hate think alright found way better perfect term superhero solo shangchi legend ten ring still exciting dazzling special visual effect incredible packed amazing performance though second partplace didnt work perfectly shangchi legend ten ring favorite probably least franchise character overall still
low expectation proved wrong exceed expectation aspect got hearttouching funny moment lot funny scene hear people laugh love awkwafina funny beautiful time became fan costume moral etc personal opinion think mc kinda flat personality cant really sympathy sidekick interesting background personality ex katy little sisterxiangling father mc downside really disappointing final battle overuse cgi cgi look cheap budget best fighting scene fight bus

dont understand flick got high rating go crazy special effect acting poor attempt bring humor u trow whole concept bin humor make connect actor film really lame made want leave theater everytime lame as attempt sort funny dialogue main character strong character dialogue annoying dont understand review rated special effect
shang chi brings lot new dynamic done subsequent movie point fight choreography fantastic martial art beautifully captured edited perfection accompanying score really pace scene well time breath taking cinematography however particularly third act tends fall back tried true formula become tiresome even someone huge fanboy mandarin greatest villain ever seen wish true iron man 3 villain however comic relief exposition character accompanying hero throughout much take bite stake third act continues faceless army versus b character complete huge cgi spectacle end seek borrows firm prior particularly black panther fun watch unfortunately home run going
